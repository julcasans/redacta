## Allegories Hidden in Still Life

Before we dive into the heart of our series, let's pause to examine a fascinating example: Pieter Claesz's 1623 painting, a masterpiece from the Dutch Golden Age. At first glance, it appears to be a classic still life, but beneath the surface lies a rich allegory of the five senses. Many works from this era subtly reference the senses, even if today we simply categorize them as still lifes.

Claesz ingeniously weaves each sense into the composition:

- **Hearing**: Musical instruments evoke the sense of sound.
- **Sight**: The painting itself, along with a mirror reflecting a wine glass, draws attention to vision.
- **Touch**: A turtle, with its hard, textured shell, symbolizes tactile sensation.
- **Taste**: Sliced bread, cake, sweets, and wine represent flavors.
- **Smell**: The foods themselves, inviting us to imagine their aromas.

All five senses are present, seamlessly integrated into the still life format.

## Allegorical Figures: Personifying Concepts

Moving from objects to figures, consider the allegorical representations found throughout art history. The painting previously discussed in class focused on hearing, but in a very different manner: through personification. Here, allegories are embodied by female figures—often Venus, accompanied by Cupid. This tradition of representing abstract concepts as women is widespread:

- **Statue of Liberty**: A woman holding a torch, symbolizing freedom.
- **Justice**: A blindfolded woman with scales, representing fairness.
- **Venus**: A woman with Cupid, embodying love and beauty.

Art transforms intangible ideas into relatable human forms, using symbolic objects to reinforce meaning.

## Jan Bruegel the Elder: Artistic Lineage and Legacy

Before exploring the series of the five senses, it's essential to understand the legacy of Jan Bruegel the Elder and his collaboration with Rubens. Rubens painted a portrait of his friend Jan Bruegel with his family, highlighting Bruegel's reputation for capturing objects, textures, and flowers with remarkable detail. This artistic dynasty extended across generations: Jan's father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder; his brother, Pieter Bruegel the Younger; his son; and even his maternal grandparents, all contributed to the family's creative heritage.

One notable work is by Jan's maternal grandfather, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who painted exquisite still lifes. His grandmother, Miken Verhus, specialized in miniatures and collaborated in her husband's workshop.

Jan Bruegel's early life was marked by loss—his father died soon after his birth, and his mother passed away a few years later. Raised by his grandmother, Jan received his first artistic training before traveling through Italy, studying in Venice, Naples, Rome, and Milan, and eventually returning to Antwerp to establish his career.

## Artistic Works and Themes: Transience in Still Life

Pieter Bruegel the Elder's "Massacre of the Innocents" is a powerful example of how themes can be altered by external forces. Emperor Rudolf II found the original subject too disturbing, prompting changes to the painting. The true theme survives in a copy by Pieter Bruegel the Younger.

Jan Bruegel the Elder, meanwhile, became renowned for his still lifes, especially floral compositions. He meticulously depicted flowers from different seasons, fallen petals, and ephemeral insects, subtly reminding viewers of the fleeting nature of beauty and pleasure—a central theme in Baroque art.

## Rubens and the Archducal Court: Patronage and Collaboration

Rubens painted two of his patrons—Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert—who were also Jan Bruegel's supporters. Isabella is depicted opening her fan, and Albert appears alongside her. Both feature in the series of the senses.

![Isabella Clara Eugenia - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Isabella_Rubens.jpg)
*Image: Isabella Clara Eugenia - Wikipedia*

Jan Bruegel settled in Antwerp in 1596, and his children were Rubens' godchildren, underscoring their close relationship. From 1606, Bruegel served as court painter, and in 1613, he accompanied Rubens on a diplomatic mission to Holland. Rubens often interceded for Bruegel, who referred to him as his "subsecretary" for resolving matters.

## The Senses: Renunciation and Allegory

Art also explores the senses through themes of renunciation. In Georges de La Tour's 1620 painting, Saint Jerome is depicted as a penitent, abandoning worldly pleasures and sensory stimulation. Penitent saints endure hunger, flagellation, and contemplation of death, viewing the senses as sources of pleasure to be forsaken for spiritual salvation.

## The Unicorn Tapestries: Medieval Allegory

The unicorn tapestries, woven around 1500, offer another perspective. Five tapestries represent the senses, while a sixth features a lady surrounded by animals and plants, with a unicorn. Here, sight is symbolized as the lady shows the unicorn its reflection in a mirror.

![Print The Lady and the Unicorn : Sight, ca. 1500 - 24x30cm ...](https://www.boutiquesdemusees.fr/files/products/31686/568128-73828bc2-xl/products-568128.jpg)
*Image: Print The Lady and the Unicorn : Sight, ca. 1500 - 24x30cm ...*

The unicorn, considered timid and only attracted by a virgin maiden, is lured and captured for its magical horn. Medieval allegories often used animal behavior to convey moral lessons, and the connection between the maiden and unicorn relates to the senses. Although the Latin words for the senses are masculine, the human figure representing each sense in Bruegel and Rubens' series is always a woman, echoing medieval associations with purity.

## The Five Senses Series: Composition and Symbolism

The success of the Five Senses series led Bruegel to create multiple versions, each with variations. The original series features human figures painted by Rubens, with Jan Bruegel the Elder responsible for the surrounding elements. The setting is a grand room with a window revealing a palace, and the central allegorical figure—a woman, likely Venus, accompanied by Cupid—anchors the composition.

Objects representing each sense are carefully arranged:

- **Sight**: Mirror, paintings
- **Hearing**: Musical instruments
- **Smell**: Flowers, perfume
- **Taste**: Fruit, wine
- **Touch**: Silk, velvet

## Hearing and Sight in Baroque Art

Baroque artists often highlighted the senses through animals and objects. Cats and deer, known for their acute hearing, and birds with their melodious songs, are frequently depicted. Bells, horns, clocks, harps, and paintings fill the scene, reinforcing the sensory theme.

## The Sense of Hearing in Baroque Art

Baroque art often uses elaborate symbolism to evoke the senses, and hearing is no exception. In one striking diagram, a palace stands as the centerpiece, flanked by animals (cat, deer, birds), musical instruments (bells, horns, harps), and songbirds. Each element is carefully chosen to represent the auditory experience, weaving together nature and culture in a harmonious tableau.

<!-- IMAGE_SEARCH -->

### The Clavichord Scene: Music and Marvel

At the heart of this artistic exploration is a painted scene centered around a clavichord. Here, ordinary people—astonished and attentive—gather with animals, all drawn to the music. These paintings, likely commissioned for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia, are modest in size (about a meter wide) but rich in detail. Remarkably, the musical score is rendered so precisely that it can be read directly from the canvas, underscoring the importance of music in the courtly life of the Archdukes.

*Diagram: A group of people and animals gathered around a clavichord, with the musical score visible above, symbolizing the sense of hearing in Baroque art.*

## Artistic Cross-References: Orpheus and the Micromosaic

In the Borghese Gallery, a micromosaic from 1618 by Marchelo Provenzale stands out. Composed of minuscule tesserae—each about $1.5 \times 1.5$ mm or $2 \times 2$ mm—it depicts Orpheus taming beasts with his music, while the mouth of hell looms in the background as he attempts to rescue his wife. This work, created in the same year as the series under discussion, exemplifies the Baroque fascination with myth and the transformative power of music.

## The Palace and Baroque Themes: From Myth to Everyday Life

Through the window, the palace belonging to the Archdukes—painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder—becomes a recurring motif. Unlike traditional mythological subjects such as Aphrodite or Mercury, these scenes feature ordinary people, sometimes using telescopes, subtly shifting the focus from legendary figures to the grandeur of architecture and scientific curiosity. The still life genre also emerges, with objects arranged without human presence, marking a significant innovation in Baroque art.

*Diagram: A Baroque palace seen through a window, with people using a telescope and objects arranged in a still life, illustrating the shift from mythological to ordinary subjects.*

## The Annunciation Triptych: Hearing as Divine Reception

The Annunciation is a recurring theme, notably in the triptych by Robert Campin. Artists often use this scene to allegorize the sense of hearing, as Mary's conception is initiated by listening to the angel Gabriel. The spoken words are so powerful they extinguish a candle, agitating the air. White lilies, symbols of purity and virginity, also reference the color white and the trumpet shape, connecting visually and sonically to the theme of hearing.

## Mythological and Musical Scenes: Joyful Company

Baroque paintings frequently depict groups of people, often in semi-nudity, playing musical instruments and celebrating together. Hendrick Van Balen's "Minerva Visiting the Muses" and Dirk HS's painting of a joyful company making music are prime examples, highlighting the communal and festive aspects of music in art.

## Apollo and Marsyas: The Perils of Musical Competition

The myth of Marsyas and Apollo is a dramatic tale of musical rivalry. Marsyas, after finding and mastering the flute, challenges Apollo, the god of music, to a duel. Apollo wins by turning his lyre, while Marsyas's flute fails to produce sound when inverted. The punishment is severe: Apollo flays Marsyas alive. José de Ribera's Baroque painting captures the agony and depth of this moment, using a diagonal composition to intensify the scene. Annibale Carracci's fresco in the Farnese Gallery also depicts this myth, echoing Michelangelo's style.

## Medieval Reference: Annunciation to the Shepherds

The clavichord image is interpreted as the Annunciation to the shepherds, set against a golden medieval background. The angel proclaims, "He is born, go find him," and the Magi follow the star to the Nativity. The scene is rendered with a sense of wonder, capturing the Holy Family in the manger and the attentive shepherds with their sheep.

*Diagram: A medieval-style scene of the Annunciation to the shepherds, with a golden background, angel announcing the birth, shepherds, and the Nativity.*

## The Sense of Sight: Cabinets of Curiosities and Collections

Transitioning to the sense of sight, Baroque art celebrates the cabinet of curiosities—a collection of rare and wondrous items amassed by those with economic power. Rudolf II of Prague, painted by Arcimboldo, is a notable collector, with works themed around the senses and the seasons. When gallery space is exhausted, frescoes adorn the ceilings, as seen in the Farnese Gallery.

## The Archdukes and Their Collections: Art and Self-Reference

The archducal couple's palace is filled with objects stimulating the sense of sight. Among the sculptures are Michelangelo's "Night" and "Aurora" from the Medici tombs, a slave, and busts of Alexander the Great, Emperor Commodus, Nero, and Laocoön. These paintings are self-referential, allowing viewers to recognize many depicted works.

## Art Galleries and Museums: The Rise of the Public

Before the 16th century, paintings were commissioned for private circles, and the concept of the public did not exist. Only in rare cases, such as Velázquez's portrait of his slave in the Pantheon, were works exhibited. Collections, like David Teniers the Younger's painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's gallery, showcase recognizable works: Saint Margaret by Raphael, a self-portrait by Titian, and others inspired by Raphael's "Descent" and Cain and Abel. Jan Brueghel the Elder's daughter married Teniers, linking the families and their collections.

## Cabinets of Curiosities: The Origin of Museums

Small cabinets of curiosities, filled with disparate elements—sculptures, scenes, snails, jewels—mark the phenomenon of accumulation in the 15th century. By the 18th century, collections became specialized, with some collectors focusing on snails or animals. The distinction between "naturalia" and "artificialia" gave rise to natural science museums and art museums, with further divisions: European paintings to fine arts museums, African sculptures to ethnographic museums.

*Diagram: A cabinet of curiosities with labeled sections for 'naturalia' (snails, animals, minerals) and 'artificialia' (paintings, sculptures, jewels), illustrating the origin of museums.*

## Trompe-l'œil and Doménico Remps: Art as Illusion

A trompe-l'œil painting by Doménico Remps represents a literal cabinet of curiosities, condensing many items into a single piece of furniture. The artist delights in breaking the glass, creating a visual illusion. Gems, stones, flower paintings, ivory, and insects are depicted, foreshadowing the evolving distinction between natural and artificial from the 17th century onward.

## The Palace Seen Through the Window

The palace visible through the window in the sense of sight is the same as the one depicted in the series, its name believed to be known but not specified here.

*Diagram: Window view of a Baroque palace, as seen in the Five Senses series.*

## Architectural Features: Decoding the Baroque Window

The intricate window design of the Baroque palace, as seen in the Five Senses series, is a showcase of architectural artistry. Each element serves both a structural and decorative purpose, contributing to the grandeur and symbolism of the palace facade.

**Key Features:**

- **Pediment**: This decorative triangular element crowns the window, echoing classical architecture and drawing the eye upward.
- **Cornice**: An ornamental molding runs along the top edge, providing a visual cap and emphasizing the horizontal lines.
- **Window Frame**: The structural border defines the window's shape and supports the glass panes.
- **Mullion**: Vertical bars divide the window into sections, creating rhythm and symmetry.
- **Balustrade**: Below the window, a decorative railing adds elegance and hints at the palace's opulence.

## Symbolism and Allegory: The Baroque Banquet Table

Moving to the allegory of taste, the Baroque banquet table is laden with meaning and abundance. At its center sits Demeter, the goddess of harvest, enjoying oysters—a symbol of luxury and fertility. Nearby, a faun pours wine, blending mythological and earthly pleasures.

**Table Highlights:**

- Swan pie, game meats, sweets, fruits, and vegetables are artfully arranged, each representing prosperity and the pleasures of the senses.
- Pairs of animals reinforce the theme of abundance, echoing the harmony and bounty of nature.

*Diagram: A Baroque banquet table with Demeter eating oysters, a faun serving wine, swan pie, sweets, fruits, vegetables, game, and pairs of animals, representing the allegory of taste.*

---

## Contrasts: Hard vs Soft Elements

The right side of the scene presents a striking contrast between hard and soft elements. Armor, surgical instruments, and tortoise shells symbolize pain, protection, and endurance. In opposition, a soft carpet, Venus and Cupid, and gentle tenderness evoke comfort and vulnerability.

**Visual Grouping:**

- **Hard Elements**: Armor, surgical tools, tortoise shell
- **Soft Elements**: Carpet, Venus & Cupid, tenderness

*Diagram: A diagram contrasting hard elements (armor, surgical instruments, tortoise shell) with soft elements (carpet, Venus and Cupid, tenderness), visually grouping them on the right and left as described.*

---

## Weapons, Pain, and Grasp

Weapons and a forge are depicted, alluding to the themes of pain and grasp. The symbolic connection is clear: swords and the forge represent both the creation and infliction of suffering, a motif that recurs throughout Baroque art.

$$

$$
\text{Forge} \longrightarrow \text{Grasp}
$$

*Diagram: A simple illustration showing weapons and a forge, with arrows indicating their symbolic connection to pain and grasp.*

## Nature and Conflict: Birds in Battle

Above, birds are shown attacking each other mid-air, a vivid representation of conflict and the untamed forces of nature. The dynamic movement and diagonal lines echo the energy and drama characteristic of Baroque compositions.

*Diagram: Birds attacking each other in mid-air, symbolizing conflict and dynamic energy.*


## Conflict and Artistic Symbolism

The theme of conflict is vividly illustrated through the depiction of two birds locked in mid-air combat. Their wings and beaks are aggressively pointed toward each other, emphasizing the tension and hostility at the heart of the scene. The central area, labeled **"Conflict!"**, marks the precise moment of their clash—a visual metaphor for confrontation and struggle.

*Diagram: A sketch of two birds attacking each other in mid-air, representing conflict.*

---

## Artistic References and Martyrdom

Baroque and Renaissance art frequently explore themes of suffering, salvation, and judgment. Among the referenced works are paintings of flagellation, surgical operations, and the iconic **Last Judgment**. This scene, rooted in traditional iconography, divides the saved and the damned, with Christ enthroned at the center:

```text
                THE LAST JUDGMENT

           +-----------------------------+
           |                             |

           |[Heaven]        [Hell]       |
           +-----------------------------+
```

**Legend:**
- Christ is central, often enthroned or with a raised hand.
- Saved (left): ascending, led by angels toward Heaven.
- Damned (right): descending, driven by demons toward Hell.

*Diagram: A diagram of the Last Judgment scene, with the saved on the left and the damned on the right, following traditional iconography.*

A notable version of this scene is by Pieter Bruegel the Younger:

![The Last Judgement - Artvee](https://mdl.artvee.com/sftb/302993rg.jpg)

Venus, a recurring figure in allegorical art, is depicted kissing Cupid, her attention momentarily distracted by earthly concerns:

*Image: Bronzino | An Allegory with Venus and Cupid | NG651 | National ...*

The defeat of Sennacherib, the Assyrian king and son of Sargon II, is another powerful motif. Sennacherib, known from biblical accounts as the invader of Judah and besieger of Jerusalem, is ultimately vanquished by an angel—a moment immortalized in art:

### Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence

The martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is another poignant subject, captured in a remarkable sculpture by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Created when Bernini was just 17, this work was carved from a single block of marble and features Saint Lawrence, the grill, fire, and coals. The intricacy of the flames and the anatomical detail are extraordinary. The sculpture resides in the Uffizi Gallery, though it may not always be visible due to restoration work.

![File:Martrydom of Saint Lawrence-Gianlorenzo Bernini-Uffizi ...](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Martrydom_of_Saint_Lawrence-Gianlorenzo_Bernini-Uffizi_Gallery.jpg)
*Image: File: Martrydom of Saint Lawrence-Gianlorenzo Bernini-Uffizi ...*

---

These artistic references—ranging from allegories of Venus and Cupid to scenes of martyrdom and judgment—underscore the Baroque fascination with both the spiritual and the corporeal, the sacred and the profane. Each work invites viewers to contemplate the deeper meanings behind conflict, suffering, and redemption, as well as the enduring power of myth and religious narrative in Western art.

## The Symbolism of Perfume Ingredients

Let's revisit the diagram that beautifully illustrates the symbolic meanings behind the ingredients of a perfume blend:

<!-- IMAGE_SEARCH -->

- **Myrrh**: Healing & Sacrifice
- **Incense**: Spiritual Elevation
- **Gold**: Wealth & Divinity
- **Sandalwood**: Purity & Serenity

Each element carries its own story, weaving together a tapestry of sensory and symbolic significance. The third ingredient, sandalwood, stands out as a wonderfully fragrant wood. As Diana Bellaneda mentioned, Venus herself might have burned sandalwood in her toilette, as depicted in Boué's work.

![Sandalwood in perfumery. Aromatic wood - Iberchem](https://iberchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/microsoftteams-image-114.jpg)
*Image: Sandalwood in perfumery. Aromatic wood - Iberchem*

## Final Note: Perfume as a Time Machine

As we wrap up, I invite you to explore the talk I shared with Diana Bellaneda, available in the Art History section of the library's website. The session, titled **"Perfume: Time Machine"**, bridges the visual and olfactory worlds—while I discussed the visual aspects, Diana delved into the history and meaning of certain flowers and scents.

Everything is interconnected. Our art history note concludes here, but it also points you toward further exploration. I leave you with a perfumed greeting, one that honors all five senses. Thank you for joining me—see you in our final classes of the year. I hope you enjoyed this journey through art, scent, and symbolism.
