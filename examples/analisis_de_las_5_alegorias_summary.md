## Allegory of the Five Senses in Baroque Art

## Main Content

Pieter Claesz’s 1623 still life uses objects to symbolize the five senses: musical instruments for hearing, a mirror and the painting for sight, a turtle shell for touch, foods and wine for taste, and foods for smell. Originally, these works referenced sensory allegories, not just still life.

Allegories in art personify abstract ideas with figures and symbols, such as Liberty (woman, torch), Justice (blindfold, scales), and Venus (Cupid, beauty). Jan Bruegel the Elder, from a prominent artistic family, collaborated with Rubens on a series depicting the senses. Bruegel’s lineage includes his father Pieter Bruegel the Elder, brother Pieter Bruegel the Younger, and grandparents Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Miken Verhus. After his parents’ deaths, Jan and his brother were raised by their grandmother, who taught them art. Jan studied in Italy, then returned to Antwerp, becoming a court painter in 1606. Rubens and Bruegel were close, sharing patrons, diplomatic missions, and family ties.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s “Massacre of the Innocents” was censored, but his son’s copy preserves its theme. Jan Bruegel specialized in detailed flower still lifes, often including fallen petals, insects, and clocks to symbolize the fleeting nature of beauty and life—a central Baroque theme.

Rubens painted portraits of Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert, rulers and patrons. Jan Bruegel’s children were Rubens’ godchildren. Baroque art often treats the senses as pleasures to be renounced, as in Georges de La Tour’s painting of Saint Jerome, where saints reject sensory stimulation.

The unicorn tapestries (c. 1500) also represent the senses. In the tapestry for sight, a maiden shows a unicorn its reflection, symbolizing purity and healing. Bruegel and Rubens’ series personifies the senses as women, influenced by medieval tradition.

Rubens (figures) and Jan Bruegel (objects) painted the Five Senses series, set in a grand room with a palace view. Venus and Cupid are central, surrounded by objects for each sense: mirror and paintings for sight, musical instruments for hearing, flowers and perfume for smell, fruit and wine for taste, silk and velvet for touch.

Hearing is depicted with animals (cats, deer, birds), bells, horns, clocks, harps, and songbirds, often in palatial settings. Scenes show people and animals gathered around a clavichord, listening to music, with visible scores, likely commissioned for the Archdukes. The paintings are highly detailed, about one meter wide.

A 1618 micromosaic by Marchelo Provenzale shows Orpheus taming beasts with music, paralleling Baroque themes. The palace in the series is the Archdukes’ residence, painted by Jan Bruegel. Baroque art shifts from mythological figures to ordinary people and introduces still life—objects without people.

The Annunciation triptych by Robert Campin is an allegory for hearing: Mary conceives by listening to Gabriel, whose words extinguish a candle and stir the air. White lilies symbolize purity; their trumpet shape alludes to hearing.

Mythological and musical scenes feature groups playing instruments, often semi-nude, as in Van Balen’s “Minerva Visiting the Muses” and Dirk HS’s joyful company. The myth of Marsyas and Apollo is depicted: Marsyas loses a musical duel and is flayed alive, illustrated by Ribera and Carracci.

A medieval reference on the clavichord shows the Annunciation to shepherds, the angel announcing Christ’s birth, and the Magi following the star. The Nativity is depicted with the Holy Family.

Sight is explored in cabinets of curiosities, collected by the wealthy like Rudolf II, whose self-portrait and Arcimboldo’s works represent senses and seasons. Galleries are filled with paintings and sculptures; when space is limited, frescoes are added, as in the Farnese Gallery.

The Archdukes’ palace contains objects stimulating sight: measurement tools, Venus and Cupid, Michelangelo’s sculptures, busts of historical figures, and Laocoön. These paintings are self-referential, allowing viewers to recognize depicted works.

Public art galleries emerged in the 16th century; previously, paintings were private. Collections, like Teniers’ painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm’s gallery, include works by Raphael and Titian. Jan Bruegel’s daughter married Teniers, who painted the collection.

Cabinets of curiosities combine disparate elements: sculptors, scenes, snails, jewels. The 15th-century accumulation led to specialized collections in the 18th century, distinguishing “naturalia” (animals, minerals) from “artificialia” (artworks, jewels), marking the origin of museums.

Doménico Remps’ trompe-l'œil painting represents a cabinet of curiosities, with gems, stones, flower paintings, ivory, and insects, illustrating the evolving distinction between natural and artificial.

The palace window in the Five Senses series features architectural elements: pediment (triangle above), cornice (molding), frame (border), mullions (vertical bars), and balustrade (railing).

Codenberg Palace, painted by Jan Bruegel the Younger, is central. In the upper section, Rubens is shown with three men: two open tulips symbolize the living, two closed tulips the deceased. A bust of Seneca and a sculpture of pugilists are present, with a dynamic scene of animals arranged diagonally, reflecting Baroque energy.

A small Raphael painting centers on Saint Cecilia among saints, part of the archducal collection. Rubens and Bruegel collaborated on works like Madonna with a garland, Rubens painting figures and Bruegel flowers.

The lower section features a bacchanal with fauns and sileni. Above the arch, a lost Titian painting depicts Venus and Ceres; Venus is near Cupid and the harvest, Ceres is linked to fruits and a transparent cup.

Venus observes a painting referencing the blind leading the blind, depicted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Another scene shows Jesus curing blindness. The collection blends pagan and Christian themes and includes scientific inventions like telescopes, magnifying glasses, and microscopes. Monkeys, a medieval motif, mock human behavior, such as a monkey wearing glasses.

Taste is illustrated at a banquet table with Demeter eating oysters and a faun serving wine. The table displays swan pie, sweets, fruits, vegetables, game, and pairs of animals, symbolizing abundance. Paintings of Demeter, the Wedding at Cana, and Adam and Eve are present. “Dulces de nieve” (snow sweets) reference Georg Flegel.

The Wedding at Cana is depicted, with Jesus at the center and musicians below, referencing the miracle of turning water into wine. Bruegel’s print contrasts the “fat kitchen” (abundance) with the “thin kitchen” (scarcity).

An oval painting below is an offering to Demeter, with figures by another artist and garlands by Bruegel. The deer from hearing is included. Links to images of the five senses are provided.

On the right, hard elements (armor, surgical instruments, tortoise shell) contrast with soft ones (carpet, Venus and Cupid). Armor symbolizes protection from pain, referencing Jesus’ flagellation and surgery without anesthesia. Weapons and a forge allude to pain and grasp. Birds are depicted attacking each other mid-air, emphasizing conflict.

Two birds face each other mid-air, wings and beaks pointed in aggression, marking their clash.

Paintings referenced include flagellation, surgery, and the Last Judgment, where Christ is central, the saved ascend to Heaven, and the damned descend to Hell. Venus is depicted kissing Cupid, distracted by mundane thoughts. The defeat of Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, is also shown.

Bernini’s sculpture of Saint Lawrence’s martyrdom, carved from a single marble block at age 17, features detailed fire and musculature, housed in the Uffizi Gallery.

Baroque art’s depiction of smell is examined. In a garden, Venus and Cupid are surrounded by fragrant flowers and animals, with wavy lines representing scent. Venus wears a garland and smells flowers; a civet, used for perfume, is present. Perfumed gloves are discussed. Suskind’s novel “Perfume” is referenced.

Guinea pigs, noted for their sense of smell, appear near a fountain releasing perfume. The artist depicts alembics and objects for perfume production: flowers are ground, distilled, purified, mixed, and bottled.

Above Venus, a relief shows the anointing of Jesus’ feet by a woman, painted by Jan Bruegel the Younger and Rubens. The woman anoints Jesus’ feet with nard, dries them with her hair, often misidentified as Mary Magdalene.

Perfume-related objects include gloves, creams, cosmetics, and a fountain. A mushroom is depicted, not used for perfume. Boué’s Rococo painting shows Venus at her toilette, attended by erotes, with a dove and a gold brazier burning fragrant coals.

Consultation with Diana Bellaneda, a perfume expert, clarifies that the depicted object is a diffuser burning resins. Ambergris, a sperm whale secretion, and myrrh, a resin for embalming, are discussed. Myrrh, incense, and gold were gifts from the Magi, symbolizing wealth, ritual, and Jesus’s destiny.

A perfume blend consists of myrrh, incense, gold, and sandalwood, each with symbolic meanings: myrrh for healing, incense for spiritual elevation, gold for wealth, and sandalwood for purity. Perfume connects sensory experiences to art history. Diana Bellaneda discussed the visual and olfactory aspects of flowers and their historical significance, emphasizing the interconnectedness of senses and art. This note concludes the art history series, inviting further exploration.

## Condensed Content

Pieter Claesz’s 1623 still life and the Five Senses series by Rubens and Jan Bruegel the Elder use objects to symbolize hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell. Musical instruments represent hearing; mirrors and paintings, sight; turtle shells, touch; foods and wine, taste; and foods, smell. Allegories personify abstract concepts with figures and symbols, as seen in Liberty, Justice, and Venus.

Jan Bruegel, from a renowned artistic family, collaborated with Rubens, sharing patrons and family ties. Bruegel specialized in detailed flower still lifes, symbolizing life’s transience. Rubens painted portraits of the Archdukes, who were patrons and godparents to Bruegel’s children. Baroque art often depicts the senses as pleasures to be renounced, as in La Tour’s Saint Jerome.

The unicorn tapestries and Bruegel-Rubens series personify the senses as women, influenced by medieval tradition. The Five Senses series features Venus and Cupid surrounded by objects for each sense, set in a grand room with a palace view.

Pieter Claesz’s 1623 still life is an allegory of the five senses, each represented by objects: musical instruments for hearing, a mirror and the painting itself for sight, a turtle’s textured shell for touch, foods and wine for taste, and foods for smell. Though now viewed as still lifes, these works originally referenced the senses.

Allegories in art personify abstract concepts as human figures with symbolic objects. For example, the Statue of Liberty (woman, torch) represents freedom, Justice (blindfolded woman, scales) stands for fairness, and Venus (woman with Cupid) embodies love and beauty.

Jan Bruegel the Elder, part of a renowned artistic dynasty, collaborated with Rubens on the five senses series. His family included his father Pieter Bruegel the Elder, brother Pieter Bruegel the Younger, and maternal grandparents Pieter Coecke van Aelst and Miken Verhus, both artists. After his parents’ deaths, Jan and his brother were raised by their grandmother, who provided their first artistic training. Jan later studied in Italy before returning to Antwerp, where his career flourished.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s “Massacre of the Innocents” was censored by Emperor Rudolf II, but Pieter Bruegel the Younger’s copy preserves the original theme. Jan Bruegel the Elder specialized in still lifes, painting flowers with meticulous detail. His works often include fallen petals, insects, and clocks, symbolizing the fleeting nature of beauty and life, a central theme in Baroque still life.

Rubens painted portraits of Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert, rulers of the Spanish Netherlands and patrons of both Rubens and Bruegel. Jan Bruegel settled in Antwerp in 1596, became court painter in 1606, and his children were Rubens’ godchildren. Their close relationship included joint diplomatic missions, with Rubens assisting Bruegel in court matters.

Art often treats the senses as sources of pleasure to be renounced, as seen in Georges de La Tour’s 1620 painting of Saint Jerome, where penitent saints reject sensory stimulation to save their souls.

The unicorn tapestries, woven around 1500, also represent the senses. In the tapestry for sight, a maiden shows a unicorn its reflection in a mirror, surrounded by animals and plants. The unicorn, attracted only by a virgin, is a medieval allegory for purity and healing. In Bruegel and Rubens’ series, the senses are personified by women, likely influenced by medieval traditions.

The original Five Senses series, painted by Rubens (figures) and Jan Bruegel the Elder (objects), features a grand room with a window showing a palace. Venus and Cupid are central, surrounded by objects symbolizing each sense: mirror and paintings for sight, musical instruments for hearing, flowers and perfume for smell, fruit and wine for taste, and silk and velvet for touch.

In Baroque art, hearing is depicted through animals with acute hearing (cats, deer, birds), bells, horns, clocks, harps, and birds in flight, often set against palatial and artistic backgrounds.

In Baroque art, the palace serves as the centerpiece, surrounded by animals (cat, deer, birds), musical instruments (bells, horns, harps), and songbirds, all symbolizing hearing. Scenes often depict ordinary people and animals gathered around a clavichord, listening to music, with the musical score visible, likely commissioned for Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia. The paintings, about one meter wide, are highly detailed, even allowing the score to be read.

In the Borghese Gallery, a micromosaic from 1618 by Marchelo Provenzale shows Orpheus taming beasts with music, with the mouth of hell in the background, paralleling the Baroque series. The palace seen through the window is the Archdukes’ residence, painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder. Baroque art shifts focus from mythological figures to ordinary people, such as those using a telescope, and introduces still life themes—objects without people, a novel approach.

The Annunciation triptych, specifically Robert Campin’s version, is referenced as an allegory for hearing: Mary conceives by listening to Gabriel, whose words extinguish a candle and agitate the air. White lilies symbolize purity and virginity, their trumpet shape alluding to hearing and the sound of the news.

Mythological and musical scenes feature groups playing instruments, often in semi-nudity, as in Hendrick Van Balen’s “Minerva Visiting the Muses” and Dirk HS’s painting of a joyful company. The myth of Marsyas and Apollo is depicted: Marsyas, after a musical duel with Apollo, is flayed alive for losing. José de Ribera’s painting and Annibale Carracci’s Farnese Gallery frescoes illustrate this story.

A medieval reference appears on the clavichord, interpreted as the Annunciation to the shepherds, with a golden background. The angel announces Christ’s birth, and the Magi arrive following the star. The Nativity is depicted with the Holy Family in the manger.

The sense of sight is explored next, set in a cabinet of curiosities collected by the wealthy, such as Rudolf II of Prague, whose self-portrait and works by Arcimboldo represent the senses and seasons. Galleries are filled with paintings and sculptures, and when space is limited, frescoes are added to ceilings, as in the Farnese Gallery.

The Archdukes’ palace contains many objects stimulating sight, including measurement tools, Venus and Cupid, Michelangelo’s sculptures (“Night,” “Aurora,” and a slave), busts of Alexander the Great, Emperor Commodus, Nero, and Laocoön. These paintings are self-referential, allowing viewers to recognize many depicted works.

Public art galleries and museums emerged in the 16th century; previously, paintings were for private circles. Collections, such as David Teniers the Younger’s painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm’s gallery, include works like Raphael’s Saint Margaret and Titian’s self-portrait. Jan Brueghel the Elder’s daughter married Teniers, who painted the collection.

Cabinets of curiosities, humble yet beautiful, combine disparate elements: sculptors, scenes like Apelles painting Campaspe with Alexander watching, snails, jewels, and more. The 15th-century phenomenon of accumulation led to specialized collections in the 18th century, distinguishing “naturalia” (snails, animals, minerals) from “artificialia” (paintings, sculptures, jewels), marking the origin of natural science and art museums.

Doménico Remps’ trompe-l'œil painting represents a literal cabinet of curiosities, with gems, stones, flower paintings, ivory, and insects, illustrating the evolving distinction between natural and artificial from the 17th century onward.

The palace seen through the window in the sense of sight is the same as depicted in the series, believed to be identifiable.

The window of the Baroque palace, as depicted in the Five Senses series, features distinct architectural elements: the pediment is a decorative triangle above the window, the cornice is an ornamental molding at the top, the window frame forms the structural border, mullions are vertical bars dividing the panes, and the balustrade is a decorative railing below.

The Codenberg Palace, painted by Jan Bruegel the Younger, is central to the discussion. In the upper section, a prominent figure appears, previously discussed in a Rubens painting from 1611. Rubens is shown with three men: he and the man beside him are alive, symbolized by two open tulips, while Rubens’ brother and mentor are deceased, represented by two closed tulips. A bust of Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, is also present. Nearby, a sculpture of pugilists, featured in a Tarantino film, stands before a dynamic scene with a tiger, lion, and leopard arranged along diagonal lines, reflecting Baroque energy and inspiring Delacroix.

A small Raphael painting centers on Saint Cecilia among other saints, part of the archducal collection. Rubens and Bruegel collaborated on works like the Madonna with a garland, where Rubens painted figures and Bruegel the flowers, as seen in "The Sense of Sight."

The lower section features a bacchanal with bearded figures, fauns, and sileni. Above the arch, a lost Titian painting (now a copy) depicts Venus and Ceres; Venus is near Cupid and the harvest, Ceres is linked to fruits and a transparent cup.

Venus is shown observing a painting referencing the biblical story of the blind leading the blind, depicted by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. In another scene, Venus witnesses Jesus curing blindness. The collection blends pagan and Christian themes and includes 17th-century scientific inventions like telescopes, magnifying glasses, and microscopes. Monkeys, a medieval motif, mock human behavior, such as a monkey donning glasses to view art.

The sense of taste is illustrated at a banquet table where Demeter, goddess of harvest, eats oysters and a faun serves wine. The table displays swan pie, sweets, fruits, vegetables, game, and pairs of animals, symbolizing abundance. Paintings of Demeter, the Wedding at Cana, and Adam and Eve are present. "Dulces de nieve" (snow sweets) are highlighted, referencing German artist Georg Flegel.

The Wedding at Cana is depicted, with Jesus at the center and musicians below, referencing the miracle of turning water into wine (Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto). Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s print contrasts the "fat kitchen" (abundance, gluttony) with the "thin kitchen" (hunger, scarcity).

An oval painting below is an offering to Demeter, with human figures by another artist and garlands of fruits and vegetables by Bruegel. The deer from the sense of hearing is also included. Links to images of the five senses are provided for comparison.

On the right, hard elements (armor, surgical instruments, tortoise shell) contrast with soft ones (carpet, Venus and Cupid, tenderness). Armor, belonging to archdukes like Philip the Handsome, symbolizes protection from pain, referencing the flagellation of Jesus and surgical operations without anesthesia. Weapons and a forge allude to pain and grasp. Birds are depicted attacking each other mid-air, emphasizing conflict and movement.

Two birds face each other mid-air, wings and beaks pointed in aggression, symbolizing conflict. The central area marks their clash.

Paintings referenced include scenes of flagellation, surgery, and the Last Judgment, where Christ is central, the saved are on the left ascending to Heaven with angels, and the damned are on the right descending to Hell with demons, following traditional iconography. Pieter Bruegel the Younger's version is noted. Venus is depicted kissing Cupid, distracted by mundane thoughts. The defeat of Sennacherib, the Assyrian king who besieged Jerusalem and was defeated by an angel, is also shown.

Bernini’s sculpture of Saint Lawrence’s martyrdom, carved from a single marble block at age 17, features detailed fire and musculature and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery.

The segment examines Baroque art’s depiction of the five senses, especially smell. In a garden, Venus and Cupid are surrounded by fragrant flowers and small animals, with wavy lines representing scent. Venus wears a garland and smells flowers; a civet, whose glands were historically used to fix perfumes, is present. Leather gloves, once perfumed to mask their odor, are discussed. Suskind’s novel "Perfume" is referenced, highlighting Grenouille’s visit to a tannery.

Guinea pigs, noted for their acute sense of smell, appear near a fountain that releases perfume. The artist often depicts alembics and objects for perfume production, illustrating the process: flowers are ground, distilled, purified, mixed, and bottled.

Above Venus, a relief shows the anointing of Jesus’ feet by a woman, a theme painted by Jan Brueghel the Younger and Rubens. The woman anoints Jesus’ feet with nard, dries them with her hair, and is often misidentified as Mary Magdalene.

Perfume-related objects include gloves, creams, cosmetics, and a fountain. A beautiful mushroom is depicted, not used for perfume. Boué’s Rococo painting shows Venus at her toilette, attended by erotes, with a dove and a gold brazier burning fragrant coals.

Consultation with Diana Bellaneda, a perfume expert, clarifies that the depicted object is a diffuser burning resins to release aroma. Ambergris, a waxy sperm whale secretion used as a perfume fixative, and myrrh, a resin for embalming, are discussed. Myrrh, incense, and gold were gifts from the Magi, symbolizing wealth, ritual, and Jesus’s destiny.

A perfume blend consists of myrrh, incense, gold, and sandalwood, each carrying symbolic meanings: myrrh represents healing and sacrifice, incense signifies spiritual elevation, gold embodies wealth and divinity, and sandalwood stands for purity and serenity. Diana Bellaneda highlighted sandalwood as a fragrant wood, which Venus might use in her toilette, as depicted in Boué’s work.

Perfume serves as a "time machine," connecting sensory experiences to art history. In a talk with Diana Bellaneda, visual and olfactory aspects of flowers and their historical significance were discussed, emphasizing the interconnectedness of senses and art. This note concludes the art history series, inviting further exploration and referencing the final classes of the year.
