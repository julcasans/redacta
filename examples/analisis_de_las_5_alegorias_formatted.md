# Art History Notes: The Five Senses in Baroque Painting

## Introduction

Welcome to a note on art history from the Library of Congress of the Nation. My name is Anabela Sánchez. We often share the art history course from the Library of Congress. About a month ago, when discussing Rubens, we looked at a work from a cycle of five paintings, specifically addressing the sense of hearing. Some aspects were left out then, as we did not cover all five senses. Today, we will analyze them in detail.

## The Five Senses in Painting

When we think about paintings of the five senses, they have been represented in various ways. We will focus on allegories—florid, literally and figuratively, tending toward abundance. Another approach is to treat the subject as a still life, which, during the Baroque period, was a relatively new genre.

### Example: Pieter Claesz's "The Five Senses" (1623)

Before delving into our main series, let's consider an example by Pieter Claesz, a Dutch artist from the Netherlands, who in 1623 painted "The Five Senses." Sometimes, when contemplating works from this period, what we now call still lifes may actually be allegories of the five senses. For example:

- **Hearing**: Represented by musical instruments.
- **Sight**: The painting itself, and specifically, a mirror reflecting a glass of wine.
- **Touch**: A turtle, with its hard, rough, and textured shell.
- **Taste**: Various foods—sliced bread, cake, sweets, and wine.
- **Smell**: Likely referenced by the same foods.

All five senses are thus present in the still life.

## Allegory and Representation

The painting we previously studied in class focused on the sense of hearing. It is quite complex and conceptually different from the still life. Here, the allegorical figure is a woman, possibly Venus, accompanied by Cupid. Each sense is represented allegorically by a female figure, often Venus, given Cupid's presence.

Allegories use human forms to represent concepts. For example, the Statue of Liberty is depicted as a woman, and Justice is shown blindfolded. These are different forms of allegorical representation.

## Jan Bruegel the Elder and Artistic Lineage

Before discussing the series of the five senses, let's talk a bit about Jan Bruegel the Elder and Rubens, who collaborated on this series. Rubens painted a portrait of his friend Jan Bruegel with his family. Jan Bruegel, also known as "Velvet" Bruegel, was famous for his depiction of objects, textures, and especially flowers.

Jan Bruegel belonged to a dynasty of painters—not only his father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, but also his brother, Pieter Bruegel the Younger, his son, and even his maternal grandparents were artists. For example, his maternal grandfather, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, painted beautiful still lifes. His grandmother, Mayken Verhulst, was also an artist, specializing in miniatures and collaborating in her husband's workshop.

When Jan Bruegel the Elder was born, his father died shortly after, and his mother passed away a few years later. Jan and his brother Pieter were raised by their grandmother, who provided their first artistic training. Later, Jan trained in other workshops and traveled extensively in Italy—Venice, Naples, Rome, Milan—before returning to Antwerp.

## The Bruegel Dynasty and Artistic Themes

Pieter Bruegel the Elder's works, such as "The Massacre of the Innocents," were sometimes altered for political reasons. For example, Emperor Rudolf II considered the original theme too terrible, so the depiction of the innocents was covered up. The original version, preserved through a copy by Pieter Bruegel the Younger, shows the true subject.

Jan Bruegel the Elder became famous for his still lifes, especially floral compositions. He often painted flowers from different seasons in the same bouquet, emphasizing the passage of time. Subtle details, like fallen petals or short-lived insects, remind us of the fleeting nature of beauty and life—a central theme in still life painting.

## Rubens, the Archducal Court, and Patronage

Rubens and Jan Bruegel both became court painters for the Archdukes. The Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II and ruler with her husband, Archduke Albert, appears in their works. Rubens painted her and the Archduke, and they will appear in the series on the senses.

Jan Bruegel settled in Antwerp in 1596. His children were godchildren of Rubens, highlighting their close relationship. From 1606, Bruegel was a court painter, and in 1613, he accompanied Rubens on a diplomatic mission to Holland. Rubens often helped Bruegel with negotiations, earning the nickname "subsecretary" from Bruegel.

## The Senses: Moral and Allegorical Contexts

Before analyzing the series, it's interesting to consider how the senses are treated. For example, in Georges de La Tour's 1620 painting of Saint Jerome as a penitent, the saint renounces worldly pleasures and sensory stimulation to save his soul. He retreats, fasts, and practices self-flagellation, viewing the senses as sources of temptation to be overcome.

## The Unicorn Tapestries (c. 1500)

Another reference is the series of six Unicorn Tapestries, woven around 1500. Five tapestries represent the senses, and a sixth, titled "À mon seul désir" (To My Only Desire), adds an intriguing dimension. In these tapestries:

- A lady is surrounded by animals and plants, with a unicorn present.
- Each tapestry represents a sense; for example, in the one for sight, the lady shows the unicorn its reflection in a mirror.
- The unicorn, a symbol of purity, can only be captured by a virgin maiden.
- The sixth tapestry, "À mon seul désir," shows the lady placing a necklace in a chest, possibly symbolizing the renunciation of desire.

Interestingly, while the Latin words for the senses are masculine, their allegorical representations are almost always female, possibly tracing back to medieval traditions.

## The Series of the Five Senses by Bruegel and Rubens

The original series was successful, leading Bruegel to reproduce the images with variations. The main human figures were painted by Rubens, while Jan Bruegel the Elder painted the rest.

### Description of the Original Series

- The scenes are set in grand rooms with notable windows leading outside, sometimes showing a palace belonging to the dukes.
- The central female figure, often accompanied by a child (likely Venus and Cupid, gods of love), represents the sense in question.

## Conclusion

This overview sets the stage for a deeper analysis of the series depicting the five senses, their allegorical meanings, and their place in Baroque art.


# The Sense of Hearing and the Sense of Sight in Baroque Art

## Introduction

This segment explores the representation of the senses, particularly hearing and sight, in Baroque art. The discussion focuses on the iconography, allegories, and specific artworks that illustrate these senses, as well as the evolution of collecting and displaying art objects.

## The Sense of Hearing

Given that we are dealing with the sense of hearing, the representations we encounter are musical instruments, as one would logically expect, but also objects that produce noise, not just pleasant sounds. For example, there are weapons, important instruments, clocks, and paintings. These paintings are not of any random subject; their themes relate to the senses.

Let's begin by recognizing animals such as the cat and the deer, which have particularly developed senses of hearing, and birds whose songs and voices are especially sonorous. There are also bells, horns (some whose names are unknown), more clocks, harps, and birds flying in the sky, as well as a palace and paintings.

### Cross-References in Paintings

- A man among animals, a detail that stands out.
- A triptych with an Annunciation scene.
- More paintings, including what appears to be a mythological scene, given the presence of nudes and the glow of halos, possibly depicting Jesus telling the fishermen, "Follow me."
- A "merry company"—people gathered to sing and play music, a common theme in Baroque works.

On the clavichord, there is a painted scene that we will examine more closely. Approaching it, we see ordinary people, dressed, astonished by some kind of superior manifestation, with animals present. This series was likely painted for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia. The paintings are not very large, about a meter wide, but the level of detail is extraordinary—even the musical score is legible, showing a piece for the Archdukes.

It is thought that these works were either commissioned by the Archdukes or created as a gift for them, given the many references to them.

### Artistic Cross-References

- In the Galleria Borghese, there is an unforgettable micromosaic piece by Marcello Provenzale from 1618, the same year as the series under discussion. This micromosaic, made with tiny tesserae (as small as 1.5 mm by 1.5 mm), depicts Orpheus taming wild beasts with his music, with the mouth of hell in the background, as he prepares to rescue his wife.
- The palace seen through the window is the same palace depicted here, one of the Archdukes' palaces, painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder. The scene shows ordinary people, not mythological figures, looking through a spyglass, with the building itself as the protagonist—a novel theme in Baroque art, where the human figure is sometimes de-emphasized.

### The Annunciation Triptych

Some works referenced can be identified, while others cannot. For example, the triptych of the Annunciation discussed here could not be specifically identified, so a general Annunciation is referenced, such as the one by Robert Campin. Artists choose to represent the Annunciation in an allegory of hearing because the conception of Mary occurs through the sense of hearing: she hears that she is chosen to bear the Son of God. The act of the Archangel Gabriel pronouncing the words stirs the air and extinguishes a candle, symbolizing the effect of sound. The white lilies, typical in Annunciation scenes, symbolize Mary's pure and virginal conception and, with their trumpet shape, likely allude to the sense of hearing and the sound of the news.

### Mythological and Musical Scenes

- There is a mythological scene with many people playing musical instruments, some semi-nude, including a faun. This is a "merry company."
- The scene of Minerva visiting the Muses by Hendrick van Balen is mentioned, where the Muses are playing instruments. This theme could be represented by other works, but in this case, Minerva is included.
- Another painting by Dirck Hals shows a merry company making music, singing, and sometimes dancing.

#### The Story of Apollo and Marsyas

- Marsyas finds a flute and plays it, boasting about his skill. He encounters Apollo, the god of music, and challenges him to a musical duel. Apollo, confident, accepts. Both play, and judges are present. At one point, Apollo suggests they switch instruments. Apollo's instrument is the lyre, which he turns and plays; Marsyas's flute, when turned, produces no sound. Marsyas loses, and Apollo punishes him by flaying him alive. This is depicted in a powerful Baroque painting by José de Ribera, an artist active in Naples and visited by Velázquez during his trip to Italy. The painting features a strong diagonal composition, typical of Baroque art.

#### Intertextuality and Medieval References

- The ceiling of the Farnese Gallery, painted by Annibale Carracci in the style of Michelangelo, features sculptural figures and medallions, including Apollo flaying Marsyas.
- A medieval reference is found in the image on the clavichord: the Annunciation to the Shepherds, with a golden background, typical of medieval art. The angel announces the birth of Christ, and the shepherds, along with the Magi, follow the star to the manger. Another image shows the Nativity, with a more abstract representation of the infant Jesus.

## The Sense of Sight

Moving on to the sense that provides the most information: sight. The image is complex and is set in what is called a "cabinet of curiosities." Those with economic means would collect anything that caught their attention, with rarities being the most prized. A notable collector was Rudolf II of Prague, whose cabinet included his own portrait by Arcimboldo and works by Arcimboldo on the senses and the seasons, as well as animals with three legs.

The gallery is filled with paintings and sculptures, and when space runs out, the ceiling is painted in fresco, as in the Farnese Gallery. There are more sculptures, and through an opening, one can see a courtyard and a building, which is another palace belonging to the Archdukes, who are depicted together in the painting.

### Objects Stimulating the Sense of Sight

The painting gathers many objects that stimulate sight, including measuring instruments, and once again, Venus and Cupid (to be discussed later). The sculptures include Michelangelo's "Night" and "Dawn" from the Medici tombs, one of his "Slaves," a bust of Alexander the Great, possibly Emperor Commodus, a head of Nero, and a head of Laocoön. These references are self-referential, and the challenge is to recognize the depicted works.

There is an interesting interplay between the ancient and the modern, such as the presence of ancient rulers like Alexander the Great and emperors alongside new rulers. There is also a notable parity between natural and artificial light sources, and between painted and natural (painted) flowers, highlighting the relationship between history, nature, and artifice.

### Versions and Copies

A second version of the painting, made entirely by Jan Brueghel the Younger, copies his father's and Rubens's work, with some changes but generally maintaining the references. Another version changes the posture of the female figure but remains set in an art gallery, predating the existence of modern galleries and museums.

### The Public and Art Collections

The concept of the public as spectators did not exist until the 16th century. Paintings were commissioned for private patrons and their circles. Only exceptionally were works exhibited, such as when Velázquez painted his slave and displayed the portrait in the Pantheon. Museums did not exist, and works were only regularly seen in churches.

David Teniers the Younger painted the collection of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, another Spanish Netherlands ruler. Some works in these collections are easily recognizable, such as a Saint Margaret by Raphael and a self-portrait by Titian. Many works are based on existing pieces, such as a Descent from the Cross by Raphael and a Cain and Abel.

Jan Brueghel the Elder's daughter married David Teniers the Younger, the artist of the aforementioned painting.

There are also more modest works, such as small cabinets of curiosities, which are delightful to see. These cabinets mix disparate elements: a sculptor, a scene of Apelles painting Campaspe with Alexander the Great watching, snails, jewels, and more. This phenomenon of accumulation was typical of the 15th century. By the 18th century, collections began to specialize, with collectors focusing on shells, paintings, live animals, representations of dead animals, and other diverse items. This led to a distinction between "naturalia" and "artificialia," the origins of natural history and art museums. Later, further distinctions arose, such as separating European paintings from African sculptures, the latter going to ethnographic museums and the former to fine arts museums.

A painting by Domenico Remps represents a literal cabinet of curiosities as a piece of furniture that opens and closes, containing a compendium of many things, with the artist playfully breaking the glass. There are gems, stones, flower paintings, ivories, and insects, showing no distinction yet between natural and artificial objects—a distinction that would develop from the 17th century onward.

The palace seen through the window in the painting representing the sense of sight is the same as previously discussed, though its name is not specified.


# The Senses in Baroque Art: A Guided Tour

## Introduction

We begin our exploration at the Codenberg Palace. Here, we encounter a representation by Jan Bruegel the Younger, a member of a renowned dynasty of artists. Let's return to our painting and discuss its elements. We'll move down and then up among the paintings displayed here.

## Central Figures and Symbolism

At the upper central part, a prominent figure appears. I must show you who this gentleman is. He also appears in another painting by Rubens that we discussed a few classes ago, dated 1611. In that painting, Rubens is on the left with three other men. Rubens and the man next to him are alive, while Rubens' brother and this mentor figure are deceased. This is symbolized by two open tulips and two closed tulips.

The sculpture represents Seneca, the philosopher of Stoic doctrine. Seneca appears here as well.

Also present is the sculpture of the boxers, which notably appears in a Tarantino film.

## Dynamic Imagery and Artistic Influence

Behind, we see the image of the house of the tiger, lion, and leopard—a highly dynamic, baroque composition full of diagonals. This image likely inspired Delacroix on numerous occasions, something we will explore next year.

## Notable Paintings and Artists

Let's continue. Here is a small painting by Raphael, featuring various saints. The central figure is Saint Cecilia. Many of these paintings belonged to the archducal collection at the time. Imagine encountering works by Raphael, Jan Bruegel, and Rubens together.

Rubens and Jan Bruegel collaborated on several works. For example, in one painting, Rubens painted the human figures, while Bruegel painted the flowers. This resulted in a Madonna with a garland, which appeared in the painting "The Sense of Sight."

Pay attention to the painting with two bacchic, diagonal figures—a bacchanal scene with memorable, small, bearded creatures nursing from a faun. There is also a silenus present.

## Lost Works and Copies

Above the archway leading to the courtyard and the palace view, there was another painting, now lost, originally by Titian. We see a copy depicting Venus and Ceres. Venus is identified by her proximity to Cupid and the harvest, while Ceres is recognized by her association with fruit and a transparent cup of grapes.

## Symbolic Scenes and Christian References

Notice Venus gazing at a painting. Before discussing that, let's examine another scene: two men carrying a pole, a third moving forward, and one appearing to fall. This references the biblical parable of the blind leading the blind, found in two different Gospels. The original work is by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

In our class on Bruegel, we discussed his painting of Flemish proverbs, which features many episodes based on folklore, including the motif of the blind leading the blind.

Returning to our image, Venus is looking at a small painting of the blind, a Christian reference. The image she observes is of Jesus healing blindness—a miraculous cure. Here, we see both pagan and Christian elements, as well as a variety of paintings. There is also reference to the invention of new ways of seeing, such as telescopes, magnifying glasses, and eventually microscopes—lenses characteristic of the 17th century, granting access to new sources of information.

Monkeys, often depicted since the Middle Ages, serve as satirical representations of human actions. For example, a monkey putting on glasses to view a painting is a humorous commentary.

## The Sense of Taste

Let's move to the sense of taste, which has fewer references than the previous section. Here, we see an allegory of taste: a woman (possibly Venus, though later identified as Demeter) sits at a table eating oysters, while a faun serves her wine. Below are many raw foods, while the table displays cooked dishes. There are decorative bird pies, such as a swan pie, a small table with sweets, and a kingfisher.

Among the sweets are "dulces de nieve" (snow sweets), which hold personal significance for me. The painting is by Georg Flegel, a German artist. My professor, Marta Satonii, once assigned us to analyze this work from a sinister perspective, which was my first encounter with the problematization of art.

## Biblical and Mythological Scenes

Other paintings include a Wedding at Cana (though the specific version is unidentified), where Jesus turns water into wine—a miracle previously discussed in relation to Veronese, Titian, and Tintoretto.

Another engraving by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depicts the "fat kitchen" and the "lean kitchen," representing gluttony and hunger, respectively. In the "fat kitchen," there is overabundance and excess, while in the "lean kitchen," everyone is starving.

We also see an Adam and Eve painting by Rubens, just before the tasting of the forbidden apple.

Finally, there is an offering to Demeter (not Aphrodite), with garlands of fruits and vegetables painted by Jan Bruegel. The human figures are not by him. The deer from "The Sense of Hearing" reappears here. Another version of the offering to Ceres is also present, highlighting the origin of the word "cereal."

## The Sense of Touch

Moving on to touch, this section is briefer. On the right, we find hard elements; on the left, softer, tender ones. Venus and Cupid reappear, with a soft carpet at their feet and a tortoise from earlier in the session. There are also references to surgical instruments and operations performed without anesthesia, evoking pain. Armor, which protects from pain, is also present, as are references to the flagellation of Jesus.

One painting shows a patient undergoing surgery without anesthesia, surrounded by onlookers. The armor collection includes pieces belonging to the archdukes, notably one from Philip the Handsome, father of Charles V and ancestor of Isabel Clara Eugenia, the recipient of these paintings.

Weapons, a forge, and scenes of predation (a bird attacking another in flight) evoke pain and grasping.

## Artistic and Religious References

In the lower part, we see fruits, a monkey, and the ever-present tortoise. This recalls Bernini's sculpture of Saint Lawrence, martyred by being roasted alive on a grill—a powerful image of pain.

Other paintings depict the flagellation, an operation, and a scene of the Last Judgment. On the left, the saved pray in relative peace; on the right, the damned are tormented by demons. This distribution follows traditional representations, with Jesus at the center, the saved on his right (our left), and the damned on his left (our right).

A version by Pieter Bruegel the Younger is mentioned. Venus is shown kissing Cupid, though distracted by other thoughts.

One painting, found in a more informal style, depicts the defeat of Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, son of Sargon II. Sennacherib is mentioned in the Bible as the invader of Judah and besieger of Jerusalem, ultimately defeated by an angel from heaven. This scene represents war and pain.

## Bernini's Saint Lawrence

Finally, we appreciate Bernini's sculpture of Saint Lawrence, created at age 17 from a single block of marble. The figure, grill, fire, and coals are all carved from one piece. The flames are particularly striking. This masterpiece is housed in the Uffizi Gallery, though I do not recall seeing it—perhaps it was being restored at the time.

# The Sense of Smell in Art

## Introduction

Lastly, we need to discuss the final sense depicted in this series: the sense of smell. In a beautiful garden where all the fragrant flowers of the universe grow, Venus and Cupid enjoy the sense of smell in the company of some small animals.

## The Scene and Its Elements

First, we see them—Venus is already smelling the flowers. She wears a small garland of flowers, similar to those the artist often paints. There is a series of curious objects. I invite you to consider this object here, which we do not know exactly what it is, but I believe we can guess. We will talk about it shortly.

The small animal here is called a civet, an African animal. It has glands that, in the past, were used—much like a skunk, I imagine. As an animal, it is very smelly and unpleasant, but those glands were used, fortunately no longer, for fixing perfumes.

For example, I wonder if they were used for gloves. Leather gloves were always perfumed because the leather had a very strong, unpleasant smell due to its processing. Gloves had to be perfumed to be wearable; otherwise, they were unbearable.

## Literary and Artistic References

Today, we are referencing many films. In the movie—or rather, the series, no, the book—*Perfume* by Süskind, one of Grenouille's destinations is a tannery, which is very stimulating for the sense of smell.

There are also guinea pigs or hamsters—probably guinea pigs, given their size—with an extremely acute sense of smell.

## The Apparent Fountain and Perfume-Making

I want to mention this apparent fountain, which actually contains coals and something that releases, we assume, perfumes. The garden is beautiful. Let's look at the flowers, which we have not yet fully appreciated.

The artist takes pleasure in representing what he also often depicts: many alembics and objects for making perfumes. We gather flowers for the same purpose.

## Iconography: The Anointing of Jesus

In the building above Venus, with sculptures and more, there is a relief showing a table, people seated, and a figure at the feet of another. What we see is the anointing of Jesus' feet by this woman. Let's see if we have a painting for this. First, we have the version by Jan Brueghel the Younger, son of Jan Brueghel the Elder. The scene is represented here by Brueghel, though it could have been by another artist, as it is a widely depicted theme in art history.

At this banquet, a sinful woman comes and anoints Jesus' feet with very expensive nard ointment, causing a scandal among the other guests. She has often been, perhaps mistakenly, identified as Mary Magdalene. She then dries his feet with her hair. There is also a work by Rubens.

## Objects Related to Perfume

Returning to the civet, we also have gloves, and many creams, cosmetics, and other items related to perfume. I have no idea what this is—it looks like cloves, but they are too large, so surely not. And the famous fountain, which we will now examine.

There is a mushroom—look how beautiful it is. Look at its little face. Very lovely. We should not hunt them for perfume; let them live peacefully.

## Rococo Art: Venus at Her Toilette

I found this beautiful work by Boué, a Rococo artist, showing Venus at her toilette. Venus, with her hair powdered in the Rococo style, is being adorned by many small cupids. The dove, an attribute of Venus, is being adorned as well. At her feet, there is a brazier or something similar, likely made of gold, with coals inside burning something fragrant, just like in our previous painting.

## Expert Consultation: Diana Bellaneda

Here, I consulted my other professor, Diana Bellaneda. A few years ago, we gave a lovely talk together about perfume in Buenos Aires. She is president of—well, I will leave the name in the video description to avoid mistakes, but it is about perfume in Buenos Aires. She was my art professor for Africa, Oceania, and Asia, but she is very involved in research and events related to perfumes.

She told me, "This is a diffuser, and what is burned inside are resins or other substances." For me, this is the shapeless object depicted in the painting. Remember, it can have multiple forms.

## Ambergris and Other Perfume Ingredients

This, or this, is, in my opinion, ambergris. I have looked up what ambergris is to share with you. Ambergris is a waxy secretion produced by the digestive system of sperm whales. This substance floats in the sea, hardens over time, and develops a sweet aroma. It is or was used in perfumery as a fixative. Similarly, civet glands were also used as fixatives for perfumes.

What else can we burn in our perfume diffuser? Myrrh. Myrrh is a resin used for embalming. That is why myrrh and incense are very expensive perfumed elements, along with gold, as gifts from the Magi at the birth of Jesus. Gold is a universal symbol of wealth. Sandalwood is related to rituals, and myrrh to embalming, because Jesus' destiny is death. That is the connection.

The third and last element Diana Bellaneda mentioned as something we can burn in these perfume diffusers is sandalwood—wonderfully scented sandalwood wood. This is another possibility, like what Venus would burn at her toilette in Boué's work.

## Related Talk: "El perfume, máquina del tiempo"

To finish, a quick self-promotion: remember the talk I gave with Diana Bellaneda, which is in the Art History section of the library's website. I will leave the link in the notes on art history, like the one we are sharing today. Everything is interconnected. In this case, it was called "El perfume, máquina del tiempo". I spoke about visual aspects, and Diana spoke about olfactory aspects related to certain flowers and their history.

## Conclusion

So, our art history note ends here, referring you to another. I stop sharing and bid you farewell in a very perfumed way, and also, since we are talking about the five senses, in a way that refers to all of them. See you in our next and last classes of the year. I think I have nothing left pending, so I hope you enjoyed it. See you soon.
