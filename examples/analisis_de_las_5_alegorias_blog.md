# Art History Notes: The Five Senses in Baroque Painting

## The Five Senses in Baroque Art: A Guided Tour

We begin our journey at the Codenberg Palace, where Jan Bruegel the Younger—scion of a celebrated artistic dynasty—offers us a vivid tableau. Let’s delve into the painting’s intricate details, moving through its layers of symbolism and artistry.

### Central Figures and Symbolism

At the upper center of the composition, a distinguished figure commands attention. This gentleman also appears in a 1611 painting by Rubens, which we discussed previously. In that work, Rubens stands on the left with three other men; two, including Rubens, are alive, while his brother and a mentor figure are deceased. This is subtly indicated by two open tulips and two closed tulips—a poignant visual metaphor.

Nearby, a sculpture of Seneca, the renowned Stoic philosopher, stands as a symbol of wisdom and endurance. The inclusion of Seneca underscores the intellectual aspirations woven into the fabric of Baroque art. Another notable sculpture is that of the boxers, a motif that has even found its way into contemporary cinema, notably in a Tarantino film.

### Dynamic Imagery and Artistic Influence

Behind these central figures, the scene bursts with energy: the house of the tiger, lion, and leopard is rendered in a dynamic, diagonal composition—quintessentially baroque in its movement and vitality. This image, with its swirling forms and dramatic tension, likely served as inspiration for Delacroix, whose own works echo such dynamism. We’ll explore these connections further in future discussions.

### Notable Paintings and Artists

The collection continues with a small Raphael painting featuring a gathering of saints, with Saint Cecilia at its heart. Many of these masterpieces once belonged to the archducal collection, creating a remarkable assembly: imagine standing before works by Raphael, Jan Bruegel, and Rubens, all in one place.

Rubens and Jan Bruegel frequently collaborated, each contributing their unique strengths. In one such painting, Rubens painted the human figures while Bruegel adorned the scene with flowers, resulting in a Madonna encircled by a lush garland—a motif that also appears in "The Sense of Sight."

Look closely at the painting with two bacchic, diagonal figures: a lively bacchanal scene featuring small, bearded creatures nursing from a faun, with a silenus present. The composition’s playful energy and mythological references are hallmarks of the period.

### Lost Works and Copies

Above the archway leading to the courtyard and palace, there once hung a painting by Titian, now lost to time. What remains is a copy depicting Venus and Ceres. Venus is easily identified by her proximity to Cupid and the harvest, while Ceres is recognized by her association with fruit and a transparent cup of grapes—a subtle nod to abundance and fertility.

### Symbolic Scenes and Christian References

Observe Venus as she gazes at a painting. Before delving into this, let’s consider another scene: two men carrying a pole, a third moving forward, and one appearing to stumble. This is a direct reference to the biblical parable of the blind leading the blind, recounted in two Gospels. The original composition is by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, whose works often drew on folklore and proverbs, including this motif.

Returning to our main image, Venus is depicted contemplating a small painting of the blind—a Christian reference. The scene she observes is that of Jesus miraculously healing blindness, blending pagan and Christian iconography within a single frame. The painting also alludes to the invention of new ways of seeing: telescopes, magnifying glasses, and, eventually, microscopes—innovations of the 17th century that expanded humanity’s visual horizons.

Monkeys, a recurring motif since the Middle Ages, appear here as satirical stand-ins for human behavior. A monkey donning glasses to scrutinize a painting offers a humorous commentary on our own attempts to see and understand.

**Next: The Sense of Taste**


## Wrapping Up: The Five Senses in Art

As we reach the end of our exploration, it's clear how deeply the five senses are woven into the fabric of art history. From the allegories of taste—where a woman, perhaps Venus or Demeter, dines on oysters and sweets like "dulces de nieve"—to the mythological and biblical scenes that illustrate abundance, hunger, temptation, and sacrifice, each sense is brought vividly to life.

**Taste** is depicted through lavish banquets and symbolic foods, such as in Georg Flegel's still lifes and Bruegel's contrasting kitchens. The biblical Wedding at Cana and Rubens' Adam and Eve remind us of the spiritual and moral dimensions of eating and desire.

**Touch** is explored through contrasts: hard and soft, pain and pleasure. Paintings and sculptures evoke the tactile world, from the softness of carpets and the coldness of armor to the agony of surgery without anesthesia and the martyrdom of saints. Bernini's *Saint Lawrence*, carved from a single block of marble at just 17 years old, stands as a testament to the power of touch—both in subject and in the artist's hand.

**Smell** transports us to fragrant gardens and perfumed interiors. The civet, gloves, and mysterious diffusers remind us of the historical importance of scent, both pleasant and pungent. Literary references, like Süskind's *Perfume*, and the use of ingredients such as ambergris, myrrh, and sandalwood, connect the olfactory sense to ritual, luxury, and even the divine. The anointing of Jesus' feet, depicted by Brueghel and Rubens, highlights the symbolic weight of fragrance in religious art.

Throughout, we see how artists use objects, animals, and mythological figures to evoke sensory experiences. The Rococo scene of Venus at her toilette, surrounded by cupids and scented with burning resins, encapsulates the era's fascination with beauty and pleasure.

### Final Thoughts

Art does more than please the eye—it invites us to taste, touch, smell, hear, and see the world anew. Each sense, rendered in paint, marble, or mosaic, becomes a bridge between the material and the spiritual, the everyday and the extraordinary.

Thank you for joining this journey through the senses in art. For those interested in delving deeper, I recommend exploring the references below, including the talk "El perfume, máquina del tiempo," which further connects visual and olfactory histories. Until next time, may your senses remain ever curious and inspired.
