## The Five Senses: Allegories and Still Life

Before delving into our series, let's consider an example: a work by Pieter Claesz, a Dutch artist from the Netherlands, who in 1623 painted the five senses. Sometimes, when contemplating works from this period, we may not realize they are allegories of the five senses, as today we simply know them as still lifes. In reality, artists are referencing the five senses, as seen here:

- **Hearing**: Music, represented by musical instruments.
- **Sight**: The painting itself, and the presence of a mirror reflecting a wine glass.
- **Touch**: The appearance of a turtle, referencing its hard, rough, and textured shell.
- **Taste**: Various foods, such as sliced bread, cake, sweets, and wine.
- **Smell**: Likely related to the same foods.

All five senses are depicted in the form of a still life.

## Allegorical Representations

The painting we previously studied in class focused on hearing. As a concept, it is very different from the still life example. This is an allegory, where the allegorical figure is a woman, possibly Venus, accompanied by Cupid. There is always an allegorical representation of each sense through a female figure, generally Venus due to Cupid's presence.

Allegories represent specific concepts in human form. For example, the Statue of Liberty is depicted as a woman, and Justice as a blindfolded woman—different forms of allegorical representation.

## Jan Bruegel the Elder and Artistic Dynasty

Before discussing the series of the five senses, let's talk about Jan Bruegel the Elder and Rubens, who collaborated on this series. Rubens painted a portrait of his friend Jan Bruegel with his family. Jan Bruegel, also known as Jan Velvet Bruegel, was famous for his depiction of objects, textures, and flowers, especially with his two children and wife, painted by Pieter Bruegel.
![The Family of Jan Brueghel the Elder - Courtauld](https://courtauld.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/P.1978.PG_.362.png)
*Image: The Family of Jan Brueghel the Elder - Courtauld*

Jan Bruegel the Elder belonged to a dynasty of painters—not only his father, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, but also his brother, Pieter Bruegel the Younger, his son, and even his maternal grandparents, who had artistic training. One notable work is by his maternal grandfather, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, who painted a beautiful still life. The grandmother, Miken Verhus, was also an artist, specializing in miniatures and collaborating in her husband's workshop.

*Image: Triptych of the Adoration of the Magi, after Pieter Coecke van ...*

When Jan Bruegel the Elder was born, his father died shortly after, and his mother passed away a few years later. Jan Bruegel and his brother Pieter Bruegel the Younger (known for infernal scenes) were raised by their grandmother, who provided their first artistic training. Later, Jan Bruegel trained in other workshops and traveled extensively in Italy—Venice, Naples, Rome, Milan—before returning to Antwerp.

## Artistic Works and Themes

We previously discussed Pieter Bruegel the Elder's "Massacre of the Innocents," where the original theme was considered too terrible by Emperor Rudolf II, leading to the covering of the innocents in the painting. The original version, preserved through a copy by Pieter Bruegel the Younger, shows the true subject matter.

*Image: Massacre of the Innocents (Bruegel) - Wikipedia*

Jan Bruegel the Elder became a renowned artist specializing in still life, often painting flowers of different seasons with great detail. Time is fundamental in still life; he subtly shows fallen petals, short-lived insects, and elements that indicate the fleeting nature of beauty and pleasure, paralleling the transience of life.

## Rubens and the Archducal Court

Rubens depicted two of his patrons, who were also Jan Bruegel's patrons: Archduchess Isabella Clara Eugenia and Archduke Albert, rulers of the Spanish Netherlands. Isabella is shown opening her fan, painted by Rubens, and Albert is also depicted. They appear in the series of the senses.
![Isabella Clara Eugenia - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Isabella_Rubens.jpg)
*Image: Isabella Clara Eugenia - Wikipedia*

Jan Bruegel settled in Antwerp in 1596, and his children were Rubens' godchildren, highlighting their close relationship. From 1606, Jan Bruegel became a painter for the archducal court, and in 1613, he accompanied Rubens on a diplomatic mission to Holland. Rubens often interceded for him, and Jan Bruegel referred to Rubens as his "subsecretary" for resolving matters.

## Treatment of the Senses in Art

Before discussing the series, it is interesting to consider how the senses are treated. For example, in a 1620 painting by French artist Georges de La Tour, Saint Jerome is depicted as a penitent. Penitent saints abandon worldly noise and sensory stimulation, suffering and punishing the flesh to save the soul. They retreat, endure hunger, flagellate themselves, and contemplate death to be prepared for heaven. Here, the senses are seen as sources of pleasure to be renounced.

## The Unicorn Tapestries

Another reference is the series of six unicorn tapestries, woven around 1500. Five tapestries represent the senses, and one extra, very interesting, features a lady surrounded by animals and plants, with the unicorn. In this case, the sense represented is sight, as the lady shows the unicorn its reflection.
![Print The Lady and the Unicorn : Sight, ca. 1500 - 24x30cm ...](https://www.boutiquesdemusees.fr/files/products/31686/568128-73828bc2-xl/products-568128.jpg)
*Image: Print The Lady and the Unicorn : Sight, ca. 1500 - 24x30cm ...*

The theme of the lady and the unicorn is medieval, illustrated in English books as miniatures showing animal behavior with a moral perspective. The unicorn is considered a timid animal, only attracted by a virgin maiden, who acts as bait. The unicorn approaches, calms down, and is captured for its magical, healing horn.

             Unicorn's Reflection

      Allegory: The unicorn gazes into the mirror,
      symbolizing sight, as the maiden lures it,
      surrounded by nature's beauty.
```
*Diagram: A medieval-style diagram showing a maiden luring a unicorn, surrounded by animals and plants, with the unicorn's reflection in a mirror, illustrating the allegory of sight.*

The connection between the maiden and the unicorn relates to the senses, as the Latin words for the senses are masculine, but the human figure representing each sense in Bruegel and Rubens' series is always a woman, possibly stemming from medieval representations associated with purity.

## Description of the Series

The series of the five senses was successful, leading Bruegel to reproduce the images multiple times with variations. The original series features human figures painted by Rubens, with all other elements by Jan Bruegel the Elder. In a grand room with a notable window leading outside, a palace belonging to the dukes is visible. The woman, accompanied by a child (likely Venus and Cupid, gods of love), is the central allegorical figure.

**Legend:**
- Window at the back shows a palace.
- Venus (central female figure) and Cupid are in the middle of the grand room.
- Surrounding them are objects symbolizing each of the five senses:
  - Sight: Mirror, paintings
  - Hearing: Musical instruments
  - Smell: Flowers, perfume
  - Taste: Fruit, wine
  - Touch: Silk, velvet

This diagram provides a clear spatial arrangement and symbolism for the original Five Senses series.

# The Sense of Hearing and Sight in Baroque Art

## Instruments and Objects Related to Hearing

We begin by recognizing animals such as cats and deer, which have a particularly developed sense of hearing, and birds whose songs and voices are especially sonorous.

- Bells, horns, and other instruments are depicted.
- Clocks, harps, and more birds are seen flying in the sky, along with a palace and paintings.

## The Clavichord Scene

At the clavichord, a painted scene is observed:

- Ordinary people, dressed, astonished by some superior manifestation, with animals present.
- This series was likely painted for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia.
- The paintings are not very large, about a meter wide, but the level of detail is extraordinary, even allowing the musical score to be read.
- The musical piece is for the Archdukes, suggesting it was commissioned by or for them.

## Artistic Cross-References

- In the Borghese Gallery, where there are many works by Bernivin, there is an unforgettable piece made in micromosaic. These are extremely tiny tesserae, about $1.5 	imes 1.5$ mm or $2 	imes 2$ mm, from 1618, the same year as the series being discussed.
- The micromosaic represents Orpheus, who tames beasts with his music. In the background, the mouth of hell appears, as he enters to rescue his wife. This work is by Marchelo Provenzale.
<!-- Image not found: Micromosaic of Orpheus taming beasts, Borghese Gallery, Marchelo Provenzale, 1618 -->

## The Palace and Baroque Themes

- The palace seen through the window is the same palace depicted here, belonging to the Archdukes, painted by Jan Brueghel the Elder.
- Scenes show ordinary people, not extraordinary figures like Aphrodite or Mercury, but people looking through a telescope, displaced from the center, perhaps making the building the protagonist—a novel theme in Baroque art.
- Still life themes are discussed, where objects appear without people, which was innovative.

**Legend:**
- Window frame: the viewpoint.
- Baroque palace: seen through the window, symbolizing grandeur.
- People with telescope: observing, representing scientific curiosity.
- Still life table: ordinary objects, showing the shift to everyday subjects.
- Arrow and text: transition from mythological to ordinary themes.

## The Annunciation Triptych

- A triptych of the Annunciation is referenced. Some works can be recognized, others not. For example, the triptych mentioned could not be found, so a generic Annunciation is brought, specifically the one by Robert Campin.
- Artists choose to represent the Annunciation in an allegory about the sense of hearing because Mary's conception occurs through hearing: she listens to the angel Gabriel, who tells her she is chosen to bear the Lord's son.
- The pronouncement of words by Gabriel moves and extinguishes the candle, agitating the air.
- The white lilies symbolize Mary's pure, virginal conception and reference the color white, which will be discussed on December 1st, as a symbol of virginity and trumpet shape, likely referencing hearing and the sound of the news.

## Mythological and Musical Scenes

- Scenes with many people playing musical instruments in semi-nudity are depicted. The "joyful company" is highlighted.
- Hendrick Van Balen's "Minerva Visiting the Muses" is mentioned, where the muses are playing instruments, and Minerva joins them.
- Dirk HS's painting of a joyful company making music is shown.

## Apollo and Marsyas

- The myth of Marsyas and Apollo is recounted: Marsyas finds a flute, plays it, and is happy. He meets Apollo, the god of music, and they have a musical duel. Apollo wins by turning his lyre, while Marsyas's flute produces no sound when inverted. Apollo punishes Marsyas by flaying him alive.
- José de Ribera's Baroque painting of this scene is described, with Marsyas tied and being flayed, creating depth with a diagonal composition.
- The ceiling of the Farnese Gallery is referenced, with Annibale Carracci's figures in the style of Michelangelo, showing Apollo flaying Marsyas.

## Medieval Reference

- The image on the clavichord is interpreted as the Annunciation to the shepherds, with a golden medieval background, year 100. The angel tells them, "He is born, go find him." The Magi will also arrive, following the star.
- The Nativity is depicted, with a curious and magnificent representation of the child Jesus.

## The Sense of Sight

- The next section deals with the sense of sight, which provides abundant information.
- The setting is a cabinet of curiosities, collected by those with economic power. Rare items are the most entertaining.
- Rudolf II of Prague is mentioned as a collector, with his self-portrait painted by Arcimboldo and works by Arcimboldo about the senses and the seasons.
- The gallery contains many paintings and sculptures. When space runs out, frescoes are painted on the ceiling, as in the Farnese Gallery.

## The Archdukes and Their Collections

- The archducal couple is present, with their palace and many objects stimulating the sense of sight.
- Measurement elements and Venus and Cupid are mentioned.
- Sculptures include Michelangelo's "Night" and "Aurora" from the Medici tombs, and one of his slaves. A bust of Alexander the Great, possibly Emperor Commodus, Nero, and a head of Laocoön are also present.
- These paintings are self-referential, allowing recognition of many depicted works.

## Art Galleries and Museums

- The concept of the public and spectators did not exist until the 16th century. Paintings were commissioned for private circles. Only in exceptional cases were works exhibited, such as Velázquez's portrait of his slave in the Pantheon.
- Collections are discussed, including David Teniers the Younger's painting of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm's collection.
- Recognizable works include Saint Margaret by Raphael, a self-portrait by Titian, and others based on Raphael's "Descent" and Cain and Abel.
- Jan Brueghel the Elder's daughter married David Teniers the Younger, who painted the collection.

## Cabinets of Curiosities

- Humble works, such as small cabinets of curiosities, are noted for their beauty and the crossing of disparate elements: sculptors, scenes like Apelles painting Campaspe with Alexander the Great watching, snails, jewels, and more.
- The phenomenon of accumulation in the 15th century is described. In the 18th century, collections became specialized: some collectors focused on snails, not paintings, and on living and dead animals.
- The distinction between "naturalia" and "artificialia" marks the origin of natural science museums and art museums, with further bifurcations: European paintings go to fine arts museums, African sculptures to ethnographic museums.

## Trompe-l'œil and Doménico Remps

- A painting represents a literal cabinet of curiosities as a piece of furniture that opens and closes, condensing many items. The artist enjoys breaking the glass, creating a trompe-l'œil effect.
- Gems, stones, flower paintings, ivory, and insects are depicted. The differentiation between natural and artificial will develop from the 17th century onward.

## The Palace Seen Through the Window

- The palace seen through the window in the sense of sight is the same as the one depicted here. The name is uncertain, but it is believed to be known.

# The Five Senses in Baroque Art

## Introduction

The Codenberg Palace is featured prominently, represented here by Jan Bruegel the Younger. This dynasty of artists is central to our discussion. Let us return to our painting and examine the works displayed, moving from the lower to the upper sections.

## Central Figures and Symbolism

In the upper central part, we see a notable figure. Previously, we discussed this gentleman in another Rubens painting from 1611. Rubens appears on the left with three other men; Rubens and the man beside him are alive, while Rubens' brother and the mentor figure are deceased. This is symbolized by two open tulips and two closed tulips. The sculpture represents Seneca, the philosopher of Stoic doctrine.

Nearby, there is also a sculpture of pugilists, which appears in a Tarantino film. Behind, we see the house of the tiger, lion, and leopard—a dynamic, baroque image full of diagonals, likely inspiring Delacroix on many occasions.

           DIAGONAL LINES

      Baroque composition with dynamic movement
      (Inspired by Delacroix)
```
**Legend:**
- Each animal (Tiger, Lion, Leopard) is placed along diagonal lines, creating a sense of movement and drama.
- The diagonal lines represent the dynamic energy typical of Baroque art.
- The arrangement is inspired by Delacroix’s vivid, swirling compositions.
*Diagram: A dynamic scene with tiger, lion, and leopard in a baroque composition with diagonal lines, inspired by Delacroix.*

## Notable Paintings and Artists

- A small painting by Raphael depicts various saints, with Saint Cecilia as the central figure.
- Many of these paintings belonged to the archducal collection.
- Rubens and Jan Bruegel collaborated on works where Rubens painted the human figures and Bruegel the flowers, such as the Madonna with a garland, which appeared in the painting "The Sense of Sight."

*Image: Rubens, Brueghel and the 'Madonna in a Garland of Flowers'*

## Bacchanals and Animality

- The lower image with two diagonal bacchic figures is a notable bacchanal, featuring memorable, bearded creatures interacting with fauns and sileni.
- Above the arch leading to the patio, there is a lost painting by Titian, now seen as a copy, showing Venus and Ceres. Venus is identified by her proximity to Cupid and the harvest, while Ceres is associated with fruits and a transparent cup.

*Image: Titian's Sacred and Profane Love: The Women, Fountain and Child ...*

## Christian and Pagan Elements

Venus is depicted looking at a painting, which references the biblical story of the blind leading the blind, found in two different gospels. This work is by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. In another painting, Venus observes a scene of Jesus curing blindness—a miraculous healing. The collection includes both pagan and Christian elements, as well as references to inventions like telescopes, magnifying glasses, and microscopes, which are characteristic of the 17th century.

Monkeys, often depicted since the Middle Ages, serve as ridiculous representations of human actions, such as a monkey putting on glasses to view a painting.

## The Sense of Taste

This section contains fewer references. The allegory of taste is depicted at a table, where a lady (possibly Demeter, goddess of abundance and harvest) eats oysters while a faun serves wine. The table features cooked foods, decorative pastries like a swan pie, sweets, fruits, vegetables, and game. Animals are shown in pairs, symbolizing abundance and prosperity.

- There is a painting of Demeter, reinforcing her presence.
- Other works include the Wedding at Cana, a Bruegel painting available as a print, and scenes of Adam and Eve.
- Sweets called "dulces de nieve" (snow sweets) are highlighted, with personal significance to the speaker, referencing the work of German artist Georg Flegel.

## The Wedding at Cana and Gula

- The Wedding at Cana is discussed, referencing the miracle of turning water into wine, with Jesus seated centrally and musicians below (Titian, Veronese, Tintoretto).
- A print by Pieter Bruegel the Elder shows the "fat kitchen" versus the "thin kitchen," representing gluttony and abundance versus hunger.

## Offerings and Demeter

- The oval painting below is an offering to Demeter, not Aphrodite, with human figures by another artist and garlands of fruits and vegetables by Jan Bruegel. The deer from the sense of hearing is also present.
- Links to images of the five senses are promised in the video description for comparison.

      "Taste" in the Five Senses series:
      - Human figures making an offering to Demeter
      - Garlands of fruits and vegetables symbolize abundance
      - Deer represents nature and harmony
      - Oval frame: classical allegory
```

This section is brief. On the right, hard elements are contrasted with soft, tender ones. Venus and Cupid reappear, with a soft carpet at their feet and a tortoise. References are made to surgical instruments and operations without anesthesia, symbolizing pain. Armor is depicted as protection from pain, with references to the flagellation of Jesus and a surgical operation.

## Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence

- The martyrdom of Saint Lawrence is referenced, with a sculpture by Bernini created at age 17 from a single block of marble, depicting the figure, grill, fire, and coals. The fire is intricately carved, and the musculature is remarkable. The sculpture is located in the Uffizi Gallery, though the speaker does not recall seeing it, possibly due to restoration.

# The Sense of Smell in Art

## Introduction

Finally, we need to discuss the last of the senses depicted in this series: the sense of smell. In a beautiful garden where all the fragrant flowers of the universe grow, Venus and Cupid enjoy the sense of smell in the company of several small animals.

*Diagram: A garden scene with Venus and Cupid surrounded by fragrant flowers and small animals, illustrating the sense of smell.*

## Description of the Scene

Venus is smelling the flowers, wearing a garland similar to those the artist often paints. There are several curious objects present. I invite you to consider this object here, whose identity is uncertain, but I believe we can guess what it is. We will discuss it shortly.
![Collection Painting Images by famous painters from past dynasties ...](http://gandhanra.art/cdn/shop/files/154-1.jpg?v=1751070789)
*Image: Collection Painting Images by famous painters from past dynasties ...*

One of the animals depicted is the civet, an African animal. It has glands that, in the past, were used for fixing perfumes. The civet itself is very odorous and unpleasant, but its glands were once used—fortunately, no longer—for perfume fixation.

*Image: Are there animals in your perfume? - The Fur-Bearers*

For example, I wonder if these glands were used for gloves. Leather gloves were always perfumed because the leather had a strong, unpleasant smell during processing. Gloves had to be perfumed to be wearable; otherwise, they were unbearable.

## Literary Reference: "Perfume" by Suskind

In the book "Perfume" by Suskind, one of Grenouille's destinations is a tannery, which is highly stimulating for the sense of smell.

## Animals and Objects

There are guinea pigs or hamsters—likely guinea pigs due to their size—with a very acute sense of smell. There is also an apparent fountain, which actually contains coals and something that releases, we assume, perfumes.
<!-- Failed to generate diagram: A diagram showing guinea pigs near a fountain containing coals and releasing perfume, highlighting their acute sense of smell. -->

The artist takes pleasure in representing what he often does: many alembics and objects for perfume production. Flowers are gathered for this purpose.

## Artistic and Religious References

In the building above Venus, with sculptures and reliefs, there is a depiction of a table, people seated, and a figure at the feet of another. This scene shows the anointing of Jesus' feet by a woman. First, we have the version by Jan Brueghel the Younger. The scene is represented by Brueghel, though it could have been by another artist, as it is a widely depicted theme in art history.

At this banquet, a sinful woman anoints Jesus' feet with expensive nard ointment, causing a scandal among the other guests. She has often been mistakenly identified as Mary Magdalene. She then dries his feet with her hair. There is also a work by Rubens depicting this scene.

## Perfume-Related Objects

Returning to the civet, we also see gloves, many creams, cosmetics, and other items related to perfume. There are objects that look like cloves, but they are too large to be cloves. The famous fountain is also present, which we will examine further.

**Explanation:**  
- The diagram shows a table with four items: Gloves, Creams, Cosmetics, and Fountain.
- Cosmetics and Fountain are visually grouped as "perfume-related objects" to highlight their connection.
- The grouping is indicated by the bracket and annotation at the bottom.

There is a mushroom—very beautiful. We should not hunt them for perfume; let them live peacefully.

## Rococo Art Reference

I found a beautiful work by Boué, a Rococo artist, showing Venus at her toilette. Venus, with her powdered hair in the Rococo style, is adorned by many small erotes. The dove is Venus's attribute. At her feet, there is a brazier or something similar made of gold, likely containing coals burning something fragrant, as in our previous painting.

## Expert Consultation: Diana Bellaneda

I consulted my professor, Diana Bellaneda, with whom I did a lovely talk a few years ago about perfume in Buenos Aires. She is president of an organization related to perfume (I will leave the name in the video description to avoid mistakes). She was my art professor for Africa, Oceania, and Asia, and she is deeply involved in perfume research and events.

She explained that the object in question is a diffuser, and what is burned inside are resins or similar substances. For me, this is the shapeless object depicted in the painting. It can take many forms.

## Ambergris and Other Perfume Ingredients

I researched ambergris to share with you. Ambergris is a waxy secretion produced by the digestive system of sperm whales. This substance floats in the sea, hardens over time, and develops a sweet aroma. It was used in perfumery as a fixative, similar to the civet's glands.
![Ambergris - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Ambergris%2C_Skagway_Museum.JPG)

Other substances burned in perfume diffusers include myrrh, a resin used for embalming. Myrrh, incense, and gold were expensive perfumed elements given as gifts by the Magi at Jesus's birth. Gold is a universal symbol of wealth, sandalwood is associated with rituals, and myrrh with embalming, as Jesus's destiny was death.

The third element Diana Bellaneda mentioned is sandalwood, a wonderfully fragrant wood, which Venus might also burn in her toilette in Boué's work.

## Final Note: Perfume as a Time Machine

To conclude, remember the talk I did with Diana Bellaneda, which is in the Art History section of the library's website. I will leave the link in the notes on art history, like the one we are sharing today. Everything is interconnected. The talk was called "Perfume: Time Machine." I discussed visual aspects, and Diana discussed olfactory aspects related to certain flowers and their history.

Our art history note ends here, referring us to another. I stop sharing and greet you in a very perfumed manner, and also, since we are talking about the five senses, in a way that refers to all of them. See you in our last classes of the year. I believe I have nothing pending, so I hope you enjoyed it. See you soon.
