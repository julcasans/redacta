## Baroque Art and the Five Senses

## Main Content

Baroque art often used allegory and still life to represent the five senses, combining abundance with symbolism. Pieter Claesz’s 1623 still life, “The Five Senses,” assigns objects to each sense: musical instruments (hearing), a mirror (sight), a turtle (touch), and food and wine (taste and smell). Human figures, usually women like Venus with Cupid, also personify the senses.

Jan Bruegel the Elder, known for detailed still lifes, collaborated with Rubens on a series about the senses. Bruegel, trained by his grandmother and influenced by Italian travels, included subtle reminders of mortality, such as fallen petals. Both Bruegel and Rubens were court painters for Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia, who appear in their works. Their close relationship is reflected in family ties and professional collaboration.

Baroque art viewed the senses through both celebratory and moral lenses. Georges de La Tour’s Saint Jerome renounces sensory pleasures, while medieval works like the Unicorn Tapestries use female figures to allegorize the senses, with a sixth tapestry symbolizing the renunciation of desire.

In the Bruegel-Rubens series, Rubens painted the allegorical figures, Bruegel the elaborate settings. The scenes, set in grand rooms with ducal palace views, feature Venus and Cupid as personifications. Hearing is depicted with musical instruments, clocks, bells, and animals with keen hearing. Paintings within paintings reference biblical and mythological stories, such as the Annunciation and Apollo and Marsyas. The works are highly detailed, with legible musical scores, and were likely made for the Archdukes.

Sight is set in a “cabinet of curiosities,” filled with paintings, sculptures, and scientific instruments, referencing both ancient and contemporary rulers. Notable sculptures include Michelangelo’s “Night” and “Dawn,” a bust of Alexander the Great, and Laocoön. The interplay between natural and artificial objects, and the distinction between “naturalia” and “artificialia,” foreshadow modern museums.

Art collections were private until the 16th century. David Teniers the Younger documented the Archduke’s collection, which included works by Raphael and Titian. Cabinets of curiosities mixed art, natural specimens, and scientific instruments, with specialization emerging later.

At Codenberg Palace, Jan Bruegel the Younger’s painting features Seneca and dynamic animal scenes, influencing later artists. The collection includes works by Raphael, Rubens, and Bruegel, with collaborative pieces and lost works known through copies.

Symbolic scenes include Venus gazing at a painting of the blind, referencing biblical parables and advances in optics—telescopes, magnifying glasses, and microscopes. Monkeys mimic human behavior as satire.

Taste is depicted allegorically: a woman, possibly Venus or Demeter, eats oysters at a table, served wine by a faun. Raw foods are below, cooked dishes and sweets above, including “dulces de nieve.” Biblical and mythological scenes include the Wedding at Cana and Rubens’ Adam and Eve before tasting the forbidden apple. Bruegel’s “Offering to Demeter” features fruit garlands and a recurring deer motif.

Touch is represented by hard objects on the right, soft on the left. Venus and Cupid appear with a soft carpet and tortoise. Surgical instruments and scenes of operations without anesthesia evoke pain, as do armor and the flagellation of Jesus. The armor collection includes pieces from the archdukes, notably Philip the Handsome. Weapons, a forge, and predatory scenes symbolize pain and grasping. Artistic and religious references include Bernini’s “Saint Lawrence,” the flagellation, and the Last Judgment. Venus kisses Cupid but seems distracted. Another painting shows the defeat of Sennacherib, symbolizing war and suffering.

Bernini’s “Saint Lawrence,” sculpted at 17 from a single marble block, features the figure, grill, fire, and coals, with striking flames, and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery.

Smell is depicted in a lush garden with Venus and Cupid among fragrant flowers and small animals. Venus wears a garland and smells flowers, surrounded by objects like a civet, whose glands were used in perfume. Leather gloves, once strongly scented, were perfumed for wearability. The text references Süskind’s “Perfume” and guinea pigs with acute smell.

A fountain releases perfumes, and the artist includes alembics and objects for perfume-making. Above Venus, a relief shows the anointing of Jesus’ feet with nard. Perfume-related objects include gloves, creams, cosmetics, and possibly ambergris, a fixative from sperm whales. Civet glands and substances like myrrh and sandalwood were also used.

A Rococo painting by Boué shows Venus at her toilette, attended by cupids, with a dove and a gold brazier burning fragrant substances. Expert Diana Bellaneda identifies the diffuser as burning resins and notes ambergris, myrrh, and sandalwood as traditional ingredients.

A related talk, “El perfume, máquina del tiempo,” explores perfume in art history. The discussion ends by referencing all five senses and inviting viewers to future classes.

## Condensed Content

Baroque art used allegory and still life to represent the five senses, often personified by Venus and Cupid or symbolized by specific objects: musical instruments for hearing, a mirror for sight, a turtle for touch, and food and wine for taste and smell. Jan Bruegel the Elder and Rubens collaborated on a series for the Archdukes, with Rubens painting allegorical figures and Bruegel the settings, filled with references to art, science, and mythology. The senses were depicted both as sources of pleasure and as moral challenges, as seen in works like La Tour’s Saint Jerome and the Unicorn Tapestries.

Sight was shown in cabinets of curiosities, reflecting the era’s fascination with collecting and the distinction between “naturalia” and “artificialia.” Collections were private until the 16th century, later documented by artists like David Teniers the Younger. Paintings referenced advances in optics and included satirical elements like monkeys.

Taste appeared in allegories featuring banquets, biblical scenes like the Wedding at Cana, and mythological offerings to Demeter. Touch was symbolized by contrasts between hard and soft objects, surgical instruments, armor, and scenes of pain or martyrdom, such as Bernini’s “Saint Lawrence.” Smell was depicted in gardens with Venus and perfume-making objects, referencing ingredients like ambergris, civet, myrrh, and sandalwood.

These works combined allegorical, moral, and scientific themes, illustrating the complex significance of the senses in Baroque art.

Baroque art frequently depicted the five senses through allegory and still life, blending abundance and symbolism. Pieter Claesz’s 1623 still life, “The Five Senses,” uses objects to represent each sense: musical instruments for hearing, a mirror for sight, a turtle for touch, food and wine for taste and smell. Such works often serve as allegories, with human figures—typically women, often Venus with Cupid—embodying each sense.

Jan Bruegel the Elder, renowned for his detailed still lifes and floral compositions, collaborated with Rubens on a celebrated series depicting the five senses. Bruegel, part of a dynasty of artists, was trained by his grandmother after his parents’ early deaths and traveled extensively in Italy before settling in Antwerp. His works, like those of his father Pieter Bruegel the Elder, often contained subtle reminders of life’s transience, such as fallen petals or ephemeral insects.

Both Bruegel and Rubens served as court painters to the Archdukes Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia, who appear in their works. Their close relationship is evident: Bruegel’s children were Rubens’s godchildren, and Rubens assisted Bruegel in court negotiations.

The senses in Baroque art were not only celebrated but also viewed through a moral lens. For example, Georges de La Tour’s painting of Saint Jerome shows the saint renouncing sensory pleasures to save his soul. Medieval works like the Unicorn Tapestries (c. 1500) also allegorize the senses, with female figures representing each sense and a sixth tapestry, “À mon seul désir,” symbolizing the renunciation of desire.

In the Bruegel-Rubens series, Rubens painted the central allegorical figures, while Bruegel handled the elaborate settings. The scenes are set in grand rooms with views of ducal palaces, featuring Venus and Cupid as personifications of the senses.

The sense of hearing is depicted with musical instruments, clocks, bells, and animals known for acute hearing, such as cats, deer, and birds. Paintings within paintings reference biblical and mythological scenes, like the Annunciation—where Mary’s conception is linked to hearing Gabriel’s words—and the story of Apollo and Marsyas, a cautionary tale about musical hubris. The level of detail is remarkable, with even musical scores legible, and the works were likely commissioned by or gifted to the Archdukes.

The sense of sight is set in a “cabinet of curiosities,” reflecting the era’s fascination with collecting rare and wondrous objects. The gallery is filled with paintings, sculptures, scientific instruments, and references to both ancient and contemporary rulers. Notable sculptures include Michelangelo’s “Night” and “Dawn,” a bust of Alexander the Great, and a head of Laocoön. The interplay between natural and artificial, ancient and modern, is emphasized, as is the evolving distinction between “naturalia” and “artificialia”—the precursors to modern natural history and art museums.

Art collections were private until the 16th century, with works rarely displayed publicly. David Teniers the Younger documented the Archduke’s collection, which included works by Raphael and Titian. Cabinets of curiosities, mixing art, natural specimens, and scientific instruments, were common, and only later did collections specialize.

At Codenberg Palace, Jan Bruegel the Younger’s painting features central figures like Seneca and dynamic animal scenes that influenced later artists such as Delacroix. The collection includes works by Raphael, Rubens, and Bruegel, with collaborative pieces like a Madonna with a garland. Lost works, such as a Titian painting of Venus and Ceres, are known through copies.

Symbolic scenes abound: Venus gazes at a painting of the blind, referencing the biblical parable of the blind leading the blind and Jesus healing blindness. The painting also alludes to technological advances in optics—telescopes, magnifying glasses, and microscopes—hallmarks of the 17th century. Monkeys, often shown mimicking human behavior, serve as satirical elements.

This overview highlights the allegorical, moral, and scientific dimensions of the senses in Baroque art, setting the stage for deeper analysis of their representation and significance.

The sense of taste is depicted through an allegory: a woman, possibly Venus or Demeter, sits at a table eating oysters, served wine by a faun. Raw foods are placed below, while the table holds cooked dishes, decorative bird pies like swan pie, sweets including "dulces de nieve" (snow sweets), and a kingfisher. The painting is by Georg Flegel. The sweets have personal significance, and the work was once analyzed from a sinister perspective in an art class.

Biblical and mythological scenes include an unidentified Wedding at Cana, where Jesus turns water into wine, a miracle also depicted by Veronese, Titian, and Tintoretto. Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s engraving contrasts the "fat kitchen" (gluttony and excess) with the "lean kitchen" (hunger and deprivation). Rubens’ Adam and Eve shows the moment before tasting the forbidden apple. Jan Bruegel’s "Offering to Demeter" features garlands of fruits and vegetables, with human figures by another artist and a recurring deer motif. Another version, "Offering to Ceres," references the origin of "cereal."

The sense of touch is represented with hard objects on the right and soft ones on the left. Venus and Cupid appear with a soft carpet and a tortoise. Surgical instruments and scenes of operations without anesthesia evoke pain, as do references to armor and the flagellation of Jesus. One painting shows surgery performed without anesthesia, surrounded by onlookers. The armor collection includes pieces from the archdukes, notably one from Philip the Handsome, ancestor of Isabel Clara Eugenia, the paintings’ recipient. Weapons, a forge, and predatory scenes (a bird attacking another) further symbolize pain and grasping.

Artistic and religious references include fruits, a monkey, and the tortoise, recalling Bernini’s sculpture of Saint Lawrence, martyred by roasting. Other works depict the flagellation, an operation, and the Last Judgment, with the saved on Jesus’ right and the damned on his left, following traditional iconography. Pieter Bruegel the Younger’s version is mentioned. Venus kisses Cupid but appears distracted. Another painting, in a more informal style, shows the defeat of Sennacherib, the Assyrian king, who besieged Jerusalem and was defeated by an angel, symbolizing war and suffering.

Bernini’s "Saint Lawrence," sculpted at age 17 from a single marble block, features the figure, grill, fire, and coals all carved together, with striking flames. The sculpture is in the Uffizi Gallery.

The sense of smell is depicted in a lush garden where Venus and Cupid enjoy fragrant flowers among small animals. Venus wears a garland and smells flowers, surrounded by curious objects, including a civet—an African animal whose glands were once used to fix perfumes. Leather gloves, once strongly scented due to processing, were perfumed for wearability. The text references Süskind’s "Perfume," where the protagonist visits a tannery, and guinea pigs with acute smell.

A fountain in the scene actually contains coals and releases perfumes. The artist includes alembics and objects for perfume-making, and flowers are gathered for this purpose. Above Venus, a relief shows the anointing of Jesus’ feet by a woman, a theme painted by Jan Brueghel the Younger and Rubens. The woman, often misidentified as Mary Magdalene, anoints Jesus’ feet with expensive nard and dries them with her hair.

Objects related to perfume include gloves, creams, cosmetics, and a mysterious object, possibly ambergris—a waxy secretion from sperm whales used as a perfume fixative. Civet glands served a similar purpose. Other substances burned in diffusers include myrrh, used for embalming and as a costly gift from the Magi, and sandalwood, associated with rituals.

A Rococo painting by Boué shows Venus at her toilette, attended by cupids, with a dove and a gold brazier burning fragrant substances. Expert Diana Bellaneda identifies the diffuser in the painting as burning resins or similar materials. She also notes ambergris, myrrh, and sandalwood as traditional perfume ingredients.

A related talk, "El perfume, máquina del tiempo," covers visual and olfactory aspects of perfume in art history.

The discussion concludes with a farewell, referencing all five senses and inviting viewers to future classes.
